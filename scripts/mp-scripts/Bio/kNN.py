"""
This module provides code for doing k-nearest-neighbors classification.

k Nearest Neighbors is a supervised learning algorithm that classifies
a new observation based the classes in its surrounding neighborhood.

Glossary:
distance   The distance between two points in the feature space.
weight     The importance given to each point for classification. 


Classes:
kNN           Holds information for a nearest neighbors classifier.


Functions:
train        Train a new kNN classifier.
calculate    Calculate the probabilities of each class, given an observation.
classify     Classify an observation into a class.

    Weighting Functions:
equal_weight    Every example is given a weight of 1.
