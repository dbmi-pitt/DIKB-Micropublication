Lowess smoother: Robust locally weighted regression.
The lowess function fits a nonparametric regression curve to a scatterplot.
The arrays x and y contain an equal number of elements; each pair
(x[i], y[i]) defines a data point in the scatterplot. The function returns
the estimated (smooth) values of y.

The smoothing span is given by f. A larger value for f will result in a
smoother curve. The number of robustifying iterations is given by iter. The
function will run faster with a smaller number of iterations."""
