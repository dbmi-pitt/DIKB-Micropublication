At the present time, these scripts are solely intended to prototype a
DIKB evidence base that uses MP and NP. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
pre-requisites
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

python libraries:

(1) Bio 
from "http://biopython.org/wiki/Download"

(2) rdflib >=4.2 with SPARQLWrapper 

(4) rdflib-jsonld
from "https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-jsonld"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program currently works by attempting to translate data in the
current DIKB evidence base to an RDF graph with NP and MP according to
the model diagrammed in the design folder.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) run python script to send sparql query against virtuoso endpoint.
output is a tsv file contains DDI assertions associated with evidences in DIKB.
 
$ python query-DIKB-DDIs.py

(2) run script to create XML/RDF graph represents drug drug
interactions in OA and Micropublication standard. This tries to fill
in some parts of the model using simple string matching. 

$ python dikbv1.2-to-MP-plus-OA.py

(3) add in the nanopublication assertion, provenance, and supporting
graphs

$ python  ../data/initial-dikb-mp-oa-Aug2014.xml > ../data/initial-dikb-nanopub-Nov2014.trig

(4) Loading the data into an RDF endpoint. For example, see the
documentation
http://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/fn_ttlp_mt_local_file.html. NOTE:
this is not quite worked out as of 11/21/2014. Once it is, the
following test query should work:

select *
where {
 ?nanopub <http://www.nanopub.org/nschema#hasAssertion> ?asrt.
  graph ?asrt
  { ?s <http://dbmi-icode-01.dbmi.pitt.edu/dikb/vocab/interactsWith> ?o.}
} LIMIT 10
