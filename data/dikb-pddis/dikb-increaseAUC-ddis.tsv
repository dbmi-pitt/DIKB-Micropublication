description:
SUBJECTS: The study was carried out as an open, randomized, crossover design. The participants were 14 volunteers; all of the participants were men with a median age of 26 years (range, 21 to 30 years). The subjects had no known heart, liver, or kidney disease according to a clinical examination, clinical chemical and hematologic screening, and electrocardiogram. No participants consumed alcohol or drugs on a regular basis at the time of the study. The volunteers consented to participate in the study on the basis of oral and written information.

METHODS: The study was divided into two periods. In period A, all volunteers took 500 mg of tolbutamide (Tolbutamide “DAK”, Nycomed Denmark, Roskilde, Denmark) as a single oral dose. In period B, the volunteers were randomly assigned to two fluvoxamine groups. One group took 150 mg/d of fluvoxamine (Fevarin 100-mg tablets, Solvay Duphar BV, Weesp, The
Netherlands) for 5 days with a single oral dose of 500 mg of tolbutamide. The other group took a dose of 75 mg of fluvoxamine for 5 days and a single oral dose of 500 mg of tolbutamide. Period A and period B were separated by at least 1 week. Fluvoxamine was given at 20.00 hours.

RESULTS: Total tolbutamide (TB) clearance (CL_TB) was calculated as follows: CL_TB = Dose/AUC in which AUC is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve calculated by means of the trapezoidal rule with extrapolation from the last measurable concentration to infinity. Complete absorption of tolbutamide from the intestine was assumed.

The mean plasma concentration of tolbutamide versus time after a single oral dose of 500 mg of tolbutamide before (period A) and during (period B) concomitant intake of 150 mg/d or 75 mg/d of fluvoxamine is shown in Fig 2. The results of the pharmacokinetic analysis are listed in Table I. Thus the median values of the total clearance of tolbutamide were 845 and 962 mL/h in the group that received 75 mg and the group that received 150 mg, respectively, before the administration of fluvoxamine. During fluvoxamine intake, the clearance values decreased to 688 and 642 mL/h, respectively, and the decrease was statistically significant both in the group that received 75 mg and in the entire group (75 mg and 150 mg) but not in the group that received 150 mg alone. The picture was even more clear for the hydroxylation clearance, for which there was a statistically significant reduction as judged from 95% confidence intervals for the median difference not comprising zero both in the 75-mg and 150-mg fluvoxamine groups. There was a tendency toward a more marked reduction in the latter group, although the difference between the two groups (150 mg versus 75 mg in period B) did not reach a level of statistical significance (Table I).

See Table I and the equation CL_TB = Dose/AUC for more information. The AUC_i/AUC for the 150mg dose was 1.50 and for the 75mg dose was 1.22."	0.5	0.15	14

This study investigated the potential for azithromycin and clarithromycin to inhibit the metabolism of atorvastatin. Although there was no interaction between azithromycin and atorvastatin, clarithromycin did have a significant effect on atorvastatin pharmacokinetic parameters. When coadministered, clarithromycin raised subject exposure (AUC24) by 82% and peak plasma concentrations by 56%. These data suggest that while azithromycin appears to be safe to coadminister with atorvastatin, clarithromycin should be avoided in patients taking this and similarly metabolized HMG-CoA inhibitors."	0.01	0.5	36

Description:
This study was conducted to determine the potential for an interaction between nefazodone, a new antidepressant, and alprazolam after single- and multiple-dose administration in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in 48 healthy male volunteers. A group of 12 subjects received either placebo twice daily, 1 mg of alprazolam twice daily, 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily, or the combination of 1 mg of alprazolam and 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily for 7 days. Serial blood samples were collected after dosing on day 1 and day 7 and before the morning dose on days 4, 5, and 6 for the determination of alprazolam and its metabolites alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (AOH) and 4-hydroxyalprazolam (4OH) and nefazodone and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone (HO-nefazodone), m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), and a triazole dione metabolite (dione) by validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Steady-state levels in plasma were reached by day 4 for alprazolam, 4OH, nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, mCPP, and dione. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis showed that at steady state, alprazolam Cmax and AUCtau values significantly increased approximately twofold and 4OH Cmax and AUCtau values significantly decreased by 40 and 26%, respectively, when nefazodone was coadministered with alprazolam. There was no effect of alprazolam on the single-dose or steady-state pharmacokinetics of nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, or dione after the coadministration of alprazolam and nefazodone.

description:
Eighteen healthy Japanese volunteers (9 men and 9 women) who were H. pylori-negative were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 25.1 +/- 3.8 years and mean body weight was 56.6 +/- 13.3 kg. Most subjects in this study had participated in our previous studies. The mutated alleles for CYP2C19, CYP2C19*3(*3), and CYP2C19*2(*2) had been identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods of De Morais et al, before this study. The CYP2C19 genotype analyses revealed 5 different patterns as follows: *1/*1 in 6, *1/*2 in 3, *1/*3 in 3, *2/*2 in 5, and *2/*3 in 1. These were divided into 3 groups, homozygous EMs (*1/*1, n=6), heterozygous EMs (*1/*2 and *1/*3, n=6), and PMs (*2/*2 and *2/*3, n=6).
METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study design in 3 phases was conducted at intervals of 2 weeks. Clarithromycin (400 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of 2 tablets, fluvoxamine (25 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of a tablet, or matched placebo was given orally twice a
day (9 AM, 9 PM) for 6 days. Six volunteers within each group were allocated to each of the 3 different drug sequences: placebo-clarithromycin-fluvoxamine, fluvoxamine-placebo-clarithromycin, or clarithromycin-fluvoxamine-placebo. On day 6, they took a single oral 60-mg dose of lansoprazole with 400 mg dose of clarithromycin, 25mg dose of fluvoxamine, or placebo after overnight fasting (9 AM). No other medications were taken during the study periods. No meal was allowed until 4 hours after the dosing (1 PM). The use of alcohol, tea, coffee, and cola was forbidden during the test days.
RESULTS: Clarithromycin treatment significantly increased Cmax and AUC_0-24 of lansoprazole in heterozygous EMs (P&lt;0.05) and in PMs (P&lt;0.01), and prolonged elimination half-life by 1.6-fold (P&lt;0.05) in PMs. Calculated from Table 1, the AUC_i/AUC were: 1.62 (homozygous EMs), 1.71 (heterozygous EMs [p&lt;0.05]), and 1.89 (PMs [p&lt;0.01])."	0.06	0.8	18

description:
SUBJECTS: 11 subjects received fluoxetine treatment (n = 4 placebo first, n = 7 alprazolam first).

METHODS: The study had a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design. Subjects attended 4 study sessions; the first 2 study sessions occurred in the absence of SSRI medications, while the final 2 sessions occurred after a minimum of 21 days of administration of SSRI medication (citalopram 20 mg or fluoxetine 20 mg). Study sessions took place at least 3 days apart. At each study session, subjects were randomly assigned to a single oral dose of alprazolam (1 mg) or placebo at 9:00 am in the morning (ie, 1 of each for the 2 sessions before SSRI administration and 1 of each for the final 2 sessions after SSRI administration). During the post-SSRI study sessions, daily SSRI dosing was continued, while blood samples were collected up to 48.0 hours (ie, SSRIs were administered at 24.0 and 48.0 hours after single-dose alprazolam administration). Trough citalopram, fluoxetine, and metabolite serum concentrations were determined on 5 occasions: on days 1 and 7 of SSRI administration, prior to alprazolam/placebo administration at study sessions 3 and 4, and 7 days after discontinuation of study medications. During the study sessions, a small standardized breakfast (bagel and apple juice) was provided 1 hour postalprazolam administration, and a sandwich and apple juice was provided 4 hours postalprazolam administration. From 8 hours postalprazolam administration, food intake was not regulated. Subjects were instructed not to consume grapefruit juice during the study due to the potential for inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme.

RESULTS: Coadministration with fluoxetine significantly increased alprazolam AUC for all time intervals: 0-3 hours (P &lt; 0.05), 0-8 hours (P &lt; 0.005), 0-48 hours (P &lt; 0.001), and 0-inf ( P &lt; 0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 1). The AUC 0-inf increased by 31.8% postfluoxetine.

SUBJECTS: Thirty healthy male (22) and female (8) volunteers participated in the study. Informed consent was obtained for all subjects. Mean (range) age, weight, and height for the subjects were 29.6 years (19-45 years), 78.3 kg (46-102 kg), and 179 cm (158-198 cm), respectively.

Twenty-eight of the 30 enrolled subjects completed the study. Two male subjects withdrew their consent, one on Day 8 during a morning clinic visit and the other on Day 12 before the morning dose of venlafaxine. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were evaluated for only 24 subjects. Four subjects were excluded from the analyses because of protocol violations. Two male subjects did not collect complete 96-hour urine samples, and 2 female subjects consumed
xanthene-containing foods or beverages during the study.

METHODS: This was an open-label drug interaction study to evaluate the effects of steady-state venlafaxine on the pharmacokinetic disposition of single oral doses of
risperidone. Single 1 mg doses of risperidone (1 mg Risperdal® tablet, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Titusville, NJ) were administered on Days 1 and 11 with 180 mL of room-temperature water at approximately 10 a.m. following an overnight fast. Multiple doses of venlafaxine (37.5 mg and 75 mg Effexor® tablets, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Radnor, PA) were administered as follows: 37.5 mg bid from Days 5 through 7 and then 75 mg twice daily from Days 8 through 14. Venlafaxine doses were administered with approximately 240 mL of room- temperature water at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. with food
(except during the designated fasting period on Day
11). Single-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone and the total active moiety were evaluated on Days 1 through 5 (risperidone alone) and on Days 11 through 15 (risperidone plus venlafaxine).

RESULTS: Risperidone mean oral clearance decreased by 38% (885 +/- 707 mL/min vs. 550 +/- 406 mL/min), and volume of distribution decreased by 17% (215 +/- 91 L vs. 178 +/- 66 L), resulting in a 32% increase in mean AUC_(0–inf) (35.3 +/- 32.1 ng x h/mL vs. 46.7 +/- 31.1 ng x h/mL) and a 29% increase in mean C_max (5.33 +/- 2.15 ng/mL vs. 6.89 +/- 2.96 ng/mL) with venlafaxine coadministration. Both risperidone AUC_(0–inf) and C_max failed to meet bioequivalence criteria (90% CI = 134%-167% and 117%-143%, respectively)."	0.001	0.15	24

Plasma concentrations of midazolam, alpha-hydroxymidazolam and fluconazole were determined and pharmacodynamic effects were measured up to 17 h. RESULTS: Both oral and intravenous fluconazole significantly increased the area under the midazolam plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-3, AUC0-17) 2- to 3-fold, the elimination half-life of midazolam 2.5-fold and its peak concentration (Cmax) 2- to 2.5-fold compared with placebo. The AUC0-3 and the Cmax of midazolam were significantly higher after oral than after intravenous administration of fluconazole. Both oral and intravenous fluconazole increased the pharmacodynamic effects of midazolam but no differences were detected between the fluconazole phases."	0.0075	0.4	9

In the nonsmoking men-only study, 10 of 11 subjects completed the study. One subject was withdrawn because of reports of several adverse events (cause not documented) before receiving the study drug. The mean (+/-SD) age of the subjects was 33 +/- 9 years, the mean height was 174.2 +/- 7.2 cm, the mean bodyweight was 73.9 +/- 9.3 kg and the mean BMI was 24.3 +/- 2.0 kg/m2. All subjects were Caucasian. In the nonsmoking women-only study, 18 of 20 subjects completed the study. Two subjects were withdrawn; one had mild to moderate adverse events related to duloxetine administration, and the other, who received only placebo, had poor venous access. The mean (+/-SD) age of the subjects was 38.2 +/- 9.8 years, the mean height was 166.5 +/- 7 cm, the mean bodyweight was 75.3 +/- 10 kg and the mean BMI was 27.1 +/- 2.8 kg/m2. Sixty percent of the subjects were Caucasian and the rest were African American.

METHODS:
The separate studies in women and men were designed identically as single-centre, subject-blind, randomized, two-way, two-period, balanced crossover studies. Duloxetine was administered in a subject-blind manner, but the infusion of aminophylline was open-label. In each period, duloxetine 60 mg and placebo were given orally twice daily on days 1–4 and once on the morning of day 5. On day 5, theophylline 197.5 mg was given as a 30-minute intravenous infusion of aminophylline 250 mg. Each aminophylline dose was separated by at least 17 days.

RESULTS:
In men, the presence of duloxetine was associated with a small, statistically insignificant increase of 7% in the theophylline C_max and the AUC_inf (table IV). However, in women, there was a statistically significant increase in the theophylline C_max (9%) and the AUC_inf (20%). When the results from both men and women were combined, there was a statistically significant increase in the theophylline AUC_inf (13%) but not in the C_max (7%). Nonetheless, the change in the theophylline AUC_inf in the presence of duloxetine was small, and the 90% CI was within the 0.8–1.25 equivalence range for men, and for men and women combined, but narrowly missed the upper boundary of the equivalence range in women (0.8–1.27)."	0.1975	0.12	28

description:
Twelve healthy volunteers (8 men and 4 women), aged 20 to 40 years, participated after giving written informed consent. All were active ambulatory non-smoking adults, with no evidence of medical disease and taking no other medications. Female subjects were not taking oral contraceptives and did not have contraceptive implants.
   The study had a double-blind, randomized, 5-way
crossover design, with at least 7 days elapsing between
treatments. Medications were separately and identically
packaged in opaque capsules and administered orally. At 8 AM on study day 1, subjects entered the outpatient Clinical Psychopharmacology Research Unit where they received the initial dose of azole (or
placebo) and remained under observation for 30 minutes. Subjects took a second dose of azole (or placebo) at home at 4 PM on day 1. On the morning of day 2, after ingesting a standardized light breakfast with no caffeine-containing food or beverages and no grapefruit juice, they returned to the Research Unit at approximately 7:30 AM. They fasted until 12 noon, after which they resumed a normal diet (without grapefruit juice or caffeine-containing food or beverages). The third dose of azole (or placebo) was given at 8 AM, and the single dose of zolpidem or placebo was given at 9 AM. A final azole (or placebo) dose was given at 5 PM.
    Coadministration of zolpidem with ketoconazole (treatment C) significantly prolonged zolpidem elimination half-life, increased total AUC, and decreased apparent oral clearance when compared to zolpidem plus placebo (treatment B; Figure 3 and Table II). Zolpidem AUC during treatment C was increased by a factor of 1.83 + 0.24 (mean +/- SE) compared to treatment B values, and clearance during treatment C was reduced to 64% +/- 7% of treatment B values.

YES -- CYP2D6 phenotyping - All classified as extensive metabolizers

ages: 24-46

description:
SUBJECTS: Nine healthy Chinese volunteers (seven men and two women) were included in the study. The ages ranged from 24 to 46 years and their weights ranged 50 to 75 kg. All subjects were healthy as assessed by a physical examination, an ECG, and blood biochemistry testing. None of the subjects smoked tobacco or drank alcohol. All subjects abstained from drugs for at least 2 weeks before and during the study. Subjects were excluded if they were receiving any medications known to induce or inhibit cytochrome P450. Pregnant women were excluded by a test for serum human chorionic gonadotropin. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

CYP2D6 phenotype: The urinary molar metabolic ratio (MR) of the subjects was calculated by use of the equation: [MR = Dextromethorphan (mg/L)/dextrorphan (mg/L) x 0.948]. Phenotype was determined on the basis of an MR value according to the method of Schmid et al. Any subject with an MR &gt;0.3 was classified as a poor metabolizer; subjects with MR values &lt;=0.3 were classified as an extensive metabolizer.

METHODS: The study was divided into two phases. The first phase examined baseline dextromethorphan metabolic phenotyping and baseline pharmacokinetics of propafenone enantiomers. The second phase was a repeat of the first phase except that it was conducted after subjects took 20 mg/day fluoxetine for 10 days. There was at least a 2-week washout period between the two phases.

RESULTS: All nine subjects had dextromethorphan MR values &lt;0.3 at baseline and were classified as having an extensive metabolizer phenotype for CYP2D6. The dextromethorphan MR for all subjects remained at less than 0.3 after pretreatment with fluoxetine (20 mg/day) for 10 days. However, there were significant differences of mean MR values before and after fluoxetine therapy (0.028 +/- 0.031 versus 0.080 +/- 0.058; P = .001), indicating a strong inhibition of the CYP2D6 activity by fluoxetine in Chinese subjects.

Metabolism of propafenone enantiomers was also impaired significantly after fluoxetine. For S-propafenone, AUC_(0-[infinity]) increased from 2238.3 +/- 725.2 ug x h x L-1 at baseline to 3371.2 +/- 986.7 ug x h x L-1 (P = .001). For R-propafenone, AUC_(0-[infinity]) also increased from 1576.3 +/- 573.1 ug x h x L-1 before fluoxetinetherapy to 2370.7 +/- 704.5 ug x h x L-1 (P = .005)."	0.4	0.02	9

SUBJECTS
Twelve healthy male and twelve healthy female subjects aged between 18 and 45 years participated in this three-period crossover study. They were extensively screened within 3 weeks of study entry and had to be medically and mentally healthy, as evidenced by medical history, full physical examination, routine clinical laboratory investigations and ECG. Their body mass index had to be within the range 19-29 kg/m2 and they were not allowed to be smokers. Subjects were screened for being extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 using dextromethorphan as a probe.

Of the 12 males and 12 female subjects enrolled into the study, three subjects (1 male, 2 females) discontinued the study due to the emergence of adverse events on days 21, 23, and 27, respectively, of the 27 day treatment period.

METHODS
Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. They were randomly assigned to one of six treatment sequences in this three-period crossover study without washout intervals. They were admitted to the clinical pharmacology institute two days before the start of the study. In order to mimic clinical practice as much as possible, paroxetine was administered in the morning and mirtazapine in the evening, with a 12h interval between administrations. From day 1 up to and including day 26 paroxetine 20 or 40 mg or placebo was administered at 9 a.m. and mirtazapine 15 or 30 mg or placebo at 9 p.m. each day.

The treatments used were: (A) 20 mg paroxetine plus one placebo paroxetine capsule at 9 a.m. and two placebo mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the first three days followed by two 20 mg paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and two placebo mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days; (B) two placebo paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and one 15 mg mirtazapine plus one placebo mirtazapine tablet at 9 p.m. for 3 days followed by two placebo paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and two 15 mg mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days; (C) 20 mg paroxetine plus one placebo paroxetine capsule at 9 a.m. and 15 mg mirtazapine plus one placebo mirtazapine tablet at 9 p.m. for 3 days followed by two 20 mg paroxetine at 9 a.m. and two 15 mg mirtazapine at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days. Thus, six possible treatment sequences (TS1 - TS6) were used (Table 1). In those treatment sequences in which either paroxetine or mirtazapine had also been administered in the preceding treatment sequence, the drug was continued at the highest dose, i.e. two 20 mg capsules for paroxetine and two 15 mg tablets for mirtazapine. Two males and two females were randomized to each of the six treatment sequences.

RESULTS

Adding paroxetine to mirtazapine treatment increased the mirtazapine plasma concentrations. The AUC_0-24 increased by approximately 17% during concomitant administration of paxoetine. Statistically significant differences were observed in AUC_0-24 and C_max,av."	0.03	0.04	20

ages: 21-34

description:
NOTE: AUC_I/AUC in the DIKB knowledge-base is from the 6 participants classified as homozygous EMs and the value is for the R-enantiomer. The AUC increase for the S-enantiomer was greater; please see the full text. 

Eighteen healthy subjects, of whom six each were homozygous extensive metabolizers (homEMs), heterozygous extensive metabolizers (hetEMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, participated in the study. Each subject received either placebo or fluvoxamine, 25 mg twice daily for 6 days, then a single oral dose of 60 mg of racemic lansoprazole. The plasma concentrations of lansoprazole enantiomers and lansoprazole sulphone were subsequently measured for 24 h post lansoprazole administration using liquid chromatography.

In the homEMs and hetEMs, fluvoxamine significantly increased the AUC(0, inf) and C max and prolonged the elimination half-life of both (R)- and (S)-lansoprazole, whereas in the PMs, the only statistically significant effect of fluvoxamine was on
the AUC(0, inf) for (R)-lansoprazole. The mean fluvoxamine-mediated percent increase in the AUC(0, inf) of (R)-lansoprazole in the homEMs compared with the PMs was significant ( P = 0.0117); however, C max did not differ among the three CYP2C19 genotypes. On the other hand, fluvoxamine induced a significant percent increase in both the AUC(0, inf) and C max for (S)-lansoprazole in the homEMs compared with the hetEMs ( P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0125, respectively) as well as compared with the PMs ( P &lt; 0.0001 for each parameter).

description:

      Eighteen healthy Japanese volunteers (9 men and 9
women) who were H. pylori-negative were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 25.1 +/- 3.8 years and mean body weight was 56.6 +/- 13.3 kg. The mutated alleles for CYP2C19, CYP2C19*3(*3), and CYP2C19*2(*2) had been identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods of De Morais et al, before this study. The CYP2C19 genotype analyses revealed 5 different patterns as follows: *1/*1 in 6, *1/*2 in 3, *1/*3 in 3, *2/*2 in 5, and *2/*3 in 1. These were divided into 3 groups, homozygous EMs (*1/*1, n = 6), heterozygous EMs (*1/*2 and *1/*3, n = 6), and PMs (*2/*2 and *2/*3, n = 6).
      A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
crossover study design in 3 phases was conducted at
intervals of 2 weeks. Fluvoxamine (25 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of a tablet (Luvox, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Osaka, Japan), or matched placebo was given orally twice a day (9 AM, 9 PM) for 6 days. On day 6, they took a single oral 60-mg
dose of lansoprazole (Takepron, Takeda Pharmaceutical
Co, Ltd, Osaka, Japan) with 25 mg dose of fluvoxamine, or placebo after overnight fasting (9 AM).
Fluvoxamine pretreatment significantly increased AUC_0-24 of lansoprazole by 3.8-fold in homozygous EMs (P&lt;0.01) and 2.5-fold in heterozygous EMs (P&lt;0.05), and prolonged elimination half-life by 3.0-fold in homozygous EMs (P&lt;0.01) and by 1.7-fold in heterozygous EMs (P&lt;0.05), respectively. There were no differences in AUC_0-24 during fluvoxamine treatment among CYP2C19 genotypes.

SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers aged 22 to 27 years (weight range, 67-95 kg; body mass index range, 21-26 kg/m2) participated in this study after having given written informed consent. The subjects were ascertained to be in good health by medical history, a full clinical examination, and standard hematologic and blood chemical laboratory tests before enrollment.
METHODS: This study was an open crossover study with 3 phases. Between phases 1 and 2, there was a 1-week-long washout period, and between phases 2 and 3, there was a washout period of 2 weeks. The first phase was a control period, in which all volunteers received a single oral dose of bupropion (Zyban sustained release, 150 mg; GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, United Kingdom). In the second and third phases the volunteers received a 4-day-long oral antiplatelet agent pretreatment in randomized balanced order with either clopidogrel (Plavix, 75 mg once daily; Sanofi Synthelabo, Guildford, United Kingdom) or ticlopidine
(Ticlid, 250 mg twice daily; Sanofi Synthelabo). On day 4, 1 hour after the last dose of the antiplatelet agent, a single 150-mg dose of bupropion was administered. Venous blood samples (10 mL each) for determination of bupropion and hydroxybupropion concentrations were taken just before and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after administration of bupropion. In all phases the volunteers fasted for 8 hours before
and 4 hours after administration of bupropion. Identical meals were provided on the 3 study days. Volunteers were also required to refrain from strenuous physical exercise, alcohol- or caffeine-containing drinks, smoking, grapefruit juice, and other medications for 2 days before and after study drug administration.
RESULTS: Both of the thienopyridine
derivatives had a significant effect on the AUC of
bupropion: in the clopidogrel phase, the bupropion
AUC increased by 60% (P = .02; 95% CI, 21% to
98%)."	0.15	0.075	12

Description: 
he pharmacokinetic interactions of sertraline and fluoxetine with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine were studied in 18 healthy male volunteers phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan. Concentrations in plasma were determined after 7 days of desipramine (50 mg/day) dosing alone, during the 21 days of desipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) coadministration (fluoxetine, 20 mg/day; sertraline, 50 mg/day), and for 21 days of continued desipramine administration after SSRI discontinuation. Desipramine Cmax was increased 4.0-fold versus 31% and AUC0-24 was increased 4.8-fold versus 23% for fluoxetine versus sertraline, respectively, relative to baseline after 3 weeks of coadministration. Desipramine trough concentrations approached baseline within 1 week of sertraline discontinuation but remained elevated for the 3-week follow-up period after fluoxetine discontinuation. Concentrations of SSRIs and their metabolites correlated significantly with desipramine concentration changes (for fluoxetine/norfluoxetine, r = 0.94 to 0.96; p &lt; 0.001; for sertraline/desmethylsertraline, r = 0.63; p &lt; 0.01).

population: 50 healthy subjects (all male)

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms?
YES -- CYP2D6 genotyping - all were extensive or ultrarapid metabolizers

ages: 18-54

description:
SUBJECTS: Sixty men aged 18-55 years were eligible to participate in the study if they had previously been genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers or ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates, on the basis of genetic testing. They were also required to have a body mass index of 18-30 kg/m2, supine blood pressure of 100-140 mmHg systolic/50-90 mmHg diastolic, and to smoke no more than 10 cigarettes, two cigars or two pipes per day. The subjects were considered to be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), serum chemistry, and hematology and urinalysis performed during the screening phase.
Exclusion criteria included: poor or intermediate CYP2D6 metabolizers, known allergy to study medications, recent history of substance abuse, history of any systemic disease or positive serology (including hepatitis B and C), bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 50 bpm) or consumption of &gt; 450 mg of caffeine per day. No medications (including non-prescription) were permitted during the course of the study, with the exception of acetaminophen (up to 1500 mg/day) for headache, anticholinergic agents for the treatment of emergent EPS and lorazepam for the management of muscle spasm at the investigator’s discretion.
Both treatment groups were balanced for demographic characteristics (Table 1). All subjects were male and aged 18-54 years, with the majority being white (75%). Ten subjects (all of whom were randomized to receive the combination of paroxetine and paliperidone ER followed by paliperidone ER alone) discontinued study medication and all in the first period (in which they received the combination regimen).

METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study (Fig. 1). The study consisted of three phases: screening, beginning within 21 days before first study drug administration; an open-label treatment phase consisting of two treatment periods; and end-of-study evaluations at study completion or upon withdrawal. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment-sequence groups (30 subjects per sequence group) according to a computer-generated randomization scheme. During the open-label treatment phase, all subjects received each of the following in order determined by randomization: one tablet of paliperidone ER 3 mg on Day 1 (Treatment A); or paroxetine 20 mg/day on Days 1-13, and one tablet of paliperidone ER 3 mg on Day 10 (Treatment B). Paliperidone ER was administered in the morning (between 07:30-10:00) while subjects were in the fasting state (overnight, for at least 10 h), and subjects continued to fast for 4 h after paliperidone ER administration prior to a standardized meal. On the day that both paroxetine and paliperidone ER were taken, paroxetine was administered in the fasted state 30 min before paliperidone ER; at all other time points, paroxetine was taken with food in the morning. There was a washout period of 14-28 days between paliperidone ER treatments.

RESULTS: The 90% CI for the ratio of geometric treatment means was within the conventional no-effect boundaries (80-125%) for C_max, but not for AUC_0-last or AUC_inf (Table 3). However, the higher total exposure to paliperidone following administration of paliperidone ER and paroxetine compared with paliperidone ER alone was not considered clinically relevant, with a ratio of geometric treatment means of 116.48% for AUC_inf (90% CI: 104.49-129.84)."	0.003	0.02	50

description:
SUBJECTS: Thirteen men entered the study (eight were white, four black, and one mixed ethnicity). The mean (range) age, weight, and height of the patients were 37.5 (21–59) years, 86.7 (49–140) kg, and 177.8 (160–193) cm, respectively. Nine men (69.2%) had schizoaffective disorder, three (23.1%) had bipolar disorder, and one (7.7%) had paranoid schizophrenia. Six patients were withdrawn because of lack of efficacy (N = 2), adverse events (N = 2), and refusal to continue (N = 2). All 13 patients were included in the safety analysis, but only the seven patients who completed the entire study were entered into the pharmacokinetic analysis.

METHODS:   Thirteen men (aged 18–60 years) with selected psychotic disorders were entered into this open-label, non-randomized, escalating-dose, pharmacokinetic trial conducted at a single center.  Psychotropic medications were withdrawn on day, 1 and patients underwent a 2-day washout period. On days 3 to 8, patients received quetiapine in escalating doses from 25 to 150 mg three times daily, at approximately 7 a.m., 3 p.m., and 11 p.m. Quetiapine 150 mg three times daily was then administered on days 9 to 18. The final dose was given on the morning of day 19. Cimetidine 400 mg was initiated on the afternoon of day 15 and was administered three times daily with each dose of quetiapine thereafter.

RESULTS: The mean plasma concentration versus time profiles for quetiapine determined on days 11, 15, and 19 were similar with a slight increase in the mean plasma concentration during coadministration with cimetidine. Using day 15 as baseline, geometric mean steady-state AUC_0–8h and C_max increased by 24% and 19%, respectively, after coadministration with cimetidine (day 19). Using day 11 as baseline, however, increases of only 10% and 4% were detected. In addition, differences between the 2 baseline days (11 and 15) in mean steady-state AUC_0–8h and C_max were 13% and 14%, respectively (intrasubject variability).

The geometric mean quetiapine AUC_0–8h,ss was significantly higher with cimetidine than without compared with day 15 (p=0.002) but not on day 11 (p=0.09). However, variability between the days without cimetidine coadministration (i.e., days 11 and 15) was also significant (p=0.04), with a change of 13% (p=0.04)."	0.45	1.2	7

SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy male volunteers aged 18-45 years participated in this study. They were extensively screened within 3 weeks of study entry and had to be medically and mentally healthy, as evidenced by medical history, full physical examination, routine clinical laboratory investigations and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Their body-mass index had to be within the range 19 +/- 29 kg/m2, and they were not allowed to be heavy smokers (less than ten cigarettes or equivalent per day). On admission to the unit, they were screened for alcohol or drug use. No concomitant medication was allowed, with the exception of paracetamol for severe (head)aches.

METHODS: Twelve male subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of two groups in this two-period crossover study, with a medication-free washout interval of at least 2 weeks. For each study period, they were admitted to the clinical pharmacology institute 1 day before the start of the study. After admission, subjects were re-screened for alcohol and drugs. During one treatment period, subjects were given cimetidine (800 mg b.i.d. orally) for 14 days, with mirtazapine (30 mg nocte orally) added from the 6th to the 12th day of this period. During the alternate treatment period, cimetidine tablets were replaced by placebo tablets. Medication was taken together with water. Standard meals and snacks were served at fixed times of day. The use of alcohol was forbidden for 48 h prior to the start of the study and up to 48 h after the last study day. There were restrictions with regard to the use of coffee, tea and chocolate. The daily dosages of mirtazapine (30 mg nocte) and cimetidine (800 mg b.i.d.) were in agreement with the manufacturers' recommendations and coincided with current therapeutic practice.

RESULTS: The combined administration of mirtazapine and cimetidine resulted in a statistically significant increase in AUC_0-24 of mirtazapine compared with the administration of mirtazapine as a single drug (AUC_0-24: 979 versus 635 ng x h/ml)."	0.03	1.6	12

route of administration: oral (both duloxetine and fluvoxamine), and IV (duloxetine)

study duration: 24 days

population: 14 healthy smokers (all male)

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms? No

ages: 18-65

description: Healthy subjects were selected by the investigators based on their medical history, physical examination, ECGs and routine clinical laboratory test results. Up to 18 male smokers (aged 18–65 years) were to be enrolled in the fluvoxamine study. Sixteen men who were smokers were enrolled, and 14 completed the study. Two subjects were withdrawn by the investigator before receiving the study drug. The mean (+/- SD) age of the subjects was 37 +/- 11 years, the mean height was 174 +/- 6 cm, the mean bodyweight was 76.9 +/- 10.6 kg and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.4 +/- 2.9 kg/m2. The majority of subjects were Caucasian (81%) and the rest were African American.

METHODS: This was an open-label, four-period, sequential crossover study. The dosing sequence started with duloxetine administration only (intravenous or oral; dosing periods 1 and 2), followed by duloxetine (intravenous or oral) in the presence of steady-state fluvoxamine (dosing periods 3 and 4). Duloxetine administration was planned on days 1, 5, 14 and 20 and fluvoxamine was administered from days 8 to 24. The sequence of intravenous and oral duloxetine dosing was randomized. The oral dose of duloxetine was a single 60-mg dose and the intravenous dose of duloxetine was a 10-mg infusion over 30 minutes. Fluvoxamine was initiated at a single dose of 50 mg for 1 day followed by 100 mg once daily for at least 16 additional days. Subjects unable to tolerate fluvoxamine 100 mg once daily were discontinued from the study. The washout period between each dose of duloxetine was a minimum of 4 days and a maximum of 14 days.

RESULTS: The oral duloxetine C_max and AUC_inf were increased by 141% (90% CI 93, 200) and 460% (90% CI 359, 584), respectively, whereas the intravenous duloxetine AUC_inf increased by 170% (90% CI 121, 230)."	0.06	0.1	14

route of administration: oral

study duration: 4 days

population: 12 healthy volunteers (all male), all nonsmokers

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms? Yes -- CYP2D6 genotypes - 8 EMs, 1 PM, 3 UMs 

ages: 20-29

description: 12 male volunteers (age range: 20–29 years; weight range: 65–89 kg) were recruited. The subjects were ascertained to be in good health by medical history, physical examination, and standard hematological and clinical chemistry tests. All subjects were non-smokers and used no concomitant medications.

All 12 subjects completed the study according to the protocol. Genotyping of CYP2D6 revealed that eight subjects could be classified as EMs: six of them were homozygous for CYP2D6*1 allele, and two of them had the genotype CYP2D6*1/*4. One subject was classified as PM having the CYP2D6*3/*4 genotype, and three subjects without *3 or *4 were classified as UMs having a CYP2D6*1/*1x2 genotype. This high frequency of UM (25%) was much more than expected, but the subjects were not selected for the study by genotype.

METHODS: The study was an open-label, randomized, three-phase crossover study with a washout period of 4 weeks between the phases. The volunteers were given either no pretreatment (control phase) or oral terbinafine (terbinafine phase) for 4 days in a randomized order. The dose of terbinafine (Lamisil 250mg tablet; Novartis Pharma, Huningue, France) was 250mg once a day at 0800 hours for 4 days. Terbinafine were self-administered by subjects except for the last doses, which were administered by the study personnel.

One hour after the last dose of terbinafine was ingested, all volunteers received 75 mg oral dose of venlafaxine (Efexor 75 mg tablet; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, New Lane, Havant, Hants, England) at 0900 hours with 150 ml of water. During all phases, the subjects fasted overnight before administration of venlafaxine and continued fasting until a standardized lunch was served 4 h after venlafaxine ingestion. The subjects were forbidden to use any other medication for 14 days before and during the study and any drug known to cause enzyme induction or inhibition for a period of 30 days before the study. Caffeine, grapefruit juice, and alcohol-containing beverages were not allowed during the study.

RESULTS: When all the subjects were examined together, without subdivision into groups according to the genotype, terbinafine pretreatment increased the area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC_0–inf) of venlafaxine 4.9-fold (range: 1.5- to 8.2-fold; P&lt;0.001).

route of administration: oral

study duration: 6 days

population: 12 healthy Japanese volunteers (9 male, 3 female)

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms?
Yes -- CYP2D6 genotypes - 4 with no mutated allele, 6 with one mutated allele, 2 with 2 mutated alleles

ages: 20-35

description:
SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy Japanese volunteers (nine males, three females) were enrolled in this study. Their mean +/- SD of age (range) was 24.8 +/- 2.5 (20–35) years and mean body weight was 58.3 +/- 8.5 (46–75) kg. The subjects had the following CYP2D6 genotypes: wt/wt (4 subjects), *10/wt (6), *10/*10 (1) and *5/*10 (1), respectively. No subjects regarded as poor metabolizers were included. These patients were divided into three groups according to the number of mutated alleles: no mutated allele in 4, one mutated allele in 6 and two mutated alleles in 2 subjects.

METHODS: A randomized crossover study design was conducted at intervals of 4 weeks. One capsule containing either 125 mg of terbinafine or a matched placebo with 240 ml of tap water was given once daily at 0800 hours for 6 days. Compliance of the test drug was confirmed by pill-count.

RESULTS: The AUC (0–48) of paroxetine during trebinafine treatment was higher than placebo by 2.53-fold (1.85, 4.58-fold). The total AUC of paroxetine during trebinafine treatment was higher than placebo by 2.88-fold (1.99, 5.41-fold).

description:
Compared to baseline, venlafaxine, sertraline, and fluoxetine caused no apparent inhibition or induction of erythromycin metabolism ( P &gt; 0.05). For nefazodone, a statistically significant inhibition was observed ( P &lt; 0.0005). Nefazodone was also the only antidepressant that caused a significant change in ALPZ disposition, decreasing its area under the concentration ï¿½ versus ï¿½ time curve (AUC; P &lt; 0.01), and increasing its elimination half-life (16.4 vs. 12.3 hours; P &lt; 0.05) compared with values at  aseline. No significant differences were found in the pharmacokinetics of ALPZ with any of the other antidepressants tested.
