description:
SUBJECTS: The study was carried out as an open, randomized, crossover design. The participants were 14 volunteers; all of the participants were men with a median age of 26 years (range, 21 to 30 years). The subjects had no known heart, liver, or kidney disease according to a clinical examination, clinical chemical and hematologic screening, and electrocardiogram. No participants consumed alcohol or drugs on a regular basis at the time of the study. The volunteers consented to participate in the study on the basis of oral and written information.

METHODS: The study was divided into two periods. In period A, all volunteers took 500 mg of tolbutamide (Tolbutamide “DAK”, Nycomed Denmark, Roskilde, Denmark) as a single oral dose. In period B, the volunteers were randomly assigned to two fluvoxamine groups. One group took 150 mg/d of fluvoxamine (Fevarin 100-mg tablets, Solvay Duphar BV, Weesp, The
Netherlands) for 5 days with a single oral dose of 500 mg of tolbutamide. The other group took a dose of 75 mg of fluvoxamine for 5 days and a single oral dose of 500 mg of tolbutamide. Period A and period B were separated by at least 1 week. Fluvoxamine was given at 20.00 hours.

RESULTS: Total tolbutamide (TB) clearance (CL_TB) was calculated as follows: CL_TB = Dose/AUC in which AUC is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve calculated by means of the trapezoidal rule with extrapolation from the last measurable concentration to infinity. Complete absorption of tolbutamide from the intestine was assumed.

The mean plasma concentration of tolbutamide versus time after a single oral dose of 500 mg of tolbutamide before (period A) and during (period B) concomitant intake of 150 mg/d or 75 mg/d of fluvoxamine is shown in Fig 2. The results of the pharmacokinetic analysis are listed in Table I. Thus the median values of the total clearance of tolbutamide were 845 and 962 mL/h in the group that received 75 mg and the group that received 150 mg, respectively, before the administration of fluvoxamine. During fluvoxamine intake, the clearance values decreased to 688 and 642 mL/h, respectively, and the decrease was statistically significant both in the group that received 75 mg and in the entire group (75 mg and 150 mg) but not in the group that received 150 mg alone. The picture was even more clear for the hydroxylation clearance, for which there was a statistically significant reduction as judged from 95% confidence intervals for the median difference not comprising zero both in the 75-mg and 150-mg fluvoxamine groups. There was a tendency toward a more marked reduction in the latter group, although the difference between the two groups (150 mg versus 75 mg in period B) did not reach a level of statistical significance (Table I).

See Table I and the equation CL_TB = Dose/AUC for more information. The AUC_i/AUC for the 150mg dose was 1.50 and for the 75mg dose was 1.22."							DIKB	"09/22/2010 12:59:40

Description:
This study was conducted to determine the potential for an interaction between nefazodone, a new antidepressant, and alprazolam after single- and multiple-dose administration in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in 48 healthy male volunteers. A group of 12 subjects received either placebo twice daily, 1 mg of alprazolam twice daily, 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily, or the combination of 1 mg of alprazolam and 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily for 7 days. Serial blood samples were collected after dosing on day 1 and day 7 and before the morning dose on days 4, 5, and 6 for the determination of alprazolam and its metabolites alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (AOH) and 4-hydroxyalprazolam (4OH) and nefazodone and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone (HO-nefazodone), m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), and a triazole dione metabolite (dione) by validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Steady-state levels in plasma were reached by day 4 for alprazolam, 4OH, nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, mCPP, and dione. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis showed that at steady state, alprazolam Cmax and AUCtau values significantly increased approximately twofold and 4OH Cmax and AUCtau values significantly decreased by 40 and 26%, respectively, when nefazodone was coadministered with alprazolam. There was no effect of alprazolam on the single-dose or steady-state pharmacokinetics of nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, or dione after the coadministration of alprazolam and nefazodone.

description:
Eighteen healthy Japanese volunteers (9 men and 9 women) who were H. pylori-negative were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 25.1 +/- 3.8 years and mean body weight was 56.6 +/- 13.3 kg. Most subjects in this study had participated in our previous studies. The mutated alleles for CYP2C19, CYP2C19*3(*3), and CYP2C19*2(*2) had been identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods of De Morais et al, before this study. The CYP2C19 genotype analyses revealed 5 different patterns as follows: *1/*1 in 6, *1/*2 in 3, *1/*3 in 3, *2/*2 in 5, and *2/*3 in 1. These were divided into 3 groups, homozygous EMs (*1/*1, n=6), heterozygous EMs (*1/*2 and *1/*3, n=6), and PMs (*2/*2 and *2/*3, n=6).
METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study design in 3 phases was conducted at intervals of 2 weeks. Clarithromycin (400 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of 2 tablets, fluvoxamine (25 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of a tablet, or matched placebo was given orally twice a
day (9 AM, 9 PM) for 6 days. Six volunteers within each group were allocated to each of the 3 different drug sequences: placebo-clarithromycin-fluvoxamine, fluvoxamine-placebo-clarithromycin, or clarithromycin-fluvoxamine-placebo. On day 6, they took a single oral 60-mg dose of lansoprazole with 400 mg dose of clarithromycin, 25mg dose of fluvoxamine, or placebo after overnight fasting (9 AM). No other medications were taken during the study periods. No meal was allowed until 4 hours after the dosing (1 PM). The use of alcohol, tea, coffee, and cola was forbidden during the test days.
RESULTS: Clarithromycin treatment significantly increased Cmax and AUC_0-24 of lansoprazole in heterozygous EMs (P&lt;0.05) and in PMs (P&lt;0.01), and prolonged elimination half-life by 1.6-fold (P&lt;0.05) in PMs. Calculated from Table 1, the AUC_i/AUC were: 1.62 (homozygous EMs), 1.71 (heterozygous EMs [p&lt;0.05]), and 1.89 (PMs [p&lt;0.01])."

SUBJECTS: 11 subjects received fluoxetine treatment (n = 4 placebo first, n = 7 alprazolam first).

METHODS: The study had a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design. Subjects attended 4 study sessions; the first 2 study sessions occurred in the absence of SSRI medications, while the final 2 sessions occurred after a minimum of 21 days of administration of SSRI medication (citalopram 20 mg or fluoxetine 20 mg). Study sessions took place at least 3 days apart. At each study session, subjects were randomly assigned to a single oral dose of alprazolam (1 mg) or placebo at 9:00 am in the morning (ie, 1 of each for the 2 sessions before SSRI administration and 1 of each for the final 2 sessions after SSRI administration). During the post-SSRI study sessions, daily SSRI dosing was continued, while blood samples were collected up to 48.0 hours (ie, SSRIs were administered at 24.0 and 48.0 hours after single-dose alprazolam administration). Trough citalopram, fluoxetine, and metabolite serum concentrations were determined on 5 occasions: on days 1 and 7 of SSRI administration, prior to alprazolam/placebo administration at study sessions 3 and 4, and 7 days after discontinuation of study medications. During the study sessions, a small standardized breakfast (bagel and apple juice) was provided 1 hour postalprazolam administration, and a sandwich and apple juice was provided 4 hours postalprazolam administration. From 8 hours postalprazolam administration, food intake was not regulated. Subjects were instructed not to consume grapefruit juice during the study due to the potential for inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme.

RESULTS: Coadministration with fluoxetine significantly increased alprazolam AUC for all time intervals: 0-3 hours (P &lt; 0.05), 0-8 hours (P &lt; 0.005), 0-48 hours (P &lt; 0.001), and 0-inf ( P &lt; 0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 1). The AUC 0-inf increased by 31.8% postfluoxetine.

SUBJECTS: Thirty healthy male (22) and female (8) volunteers participated in the study. Informed consent was obtained for all subjects. Mean (range) age, weight, and height for the subjects were 29.6 years (19-45 years), 78.3 kg (46-102 kg), and 179 cm (158-198 cm), respectively.

Twenty-eight of the 30 enrolled subjects completed the study. Two male subjects withdrew their consent, one on Day 8 during a morning clinic visit and the other on Day 12 before the morning dose of venlafaxine. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were evaluated for only 24 subjects. Four subjects were excluded from the analyses because of protocol violations. Two male subjects did not collect complete 96-hour urine samples, and 2 female subjects consumed
xanthene-containing foods or beverages during the study.

METHODS: This was an open-label drug interaction study to evaluate the effects of steady-state venlafaxine on the pharmacokinetic disposition of single oral doses of
risperidone. Single 1 mg doses of risperidone (1 mg Risperdal® tablet, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Titusville, NJ) were administered on Days 1 and 11 with 180 mL of room-temperature water at approximately 10 a.m. following an overnight fast. Multiple doses of venlafaxine (37.5 mg and 75 mg Effexor® tablets, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Radnor, PA) were administered as follows: 37.5 mg bid from Days 5 through 7 and then 75 mg twice daily from Days 8 through 14. Venlafaxine doses were administered with approximately 240 mL of room- temperature water at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. with food
(except during the designated fasting period on Day
11). Single-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone and the total active moiety were evaluated on Days 1 through 5 (risperidone alone) and on Days 11 through 15 (risperidone plus venlafaxine).

RESULTS: Risperidone mean oral clearance decreased by 38% (885 +/- 707 mL/min vs. 550 +/- 406 mL/min), and volume of distribution decreased by 17% (215 +/- 91 L vs. 178 +/- 66 L), resulting in a 32% increase in mean AUC_(0–inf) (35.3 +/- 32.1 ng x h/mL vs. 46.7 +/- 31.1 ng x h/mL) and a 29% increase in mean C_max (5.33 +/- 2.15 ng/mL vs. 6.89 +/- 2.96 ng/mL) with venlafaxine coadministration.

SUBJECTS: 7 subjects in group 2 (5 smokers, 2 nonsmokers) age ranged from 25-44 (mean 34 +/- 8.3yrs.) and weight from 69.9-81.2 kg (mean 74.0 +/- 4.2 kg). Eighty-four percent of subjects were smokers. Sixty-three percent were Caucasian and 37% were African-American.

METHODS: A two-way, randomized, crossover study was performed to assess the pharmacokinetics of theophylline administered with placebo or after administration of 9 days of dosing with either olanzapine or cimetidine. Subjects were divided into two groups. Group 1 received theophylline after olanzapine or placebo and group 2 received theophylline after cimetidine or placebo. Cimetidine (Tagamet) 400 mg orally 3 times/day was administered approximately every 8 hours for 9 days (27 total doses). Placebo was administered in the same manner as cimetidine or olanzapine, corresponding to study group. Aminophylline was admininstered as a single intravenous dose of 350 mg over 30 minutes on the last day of each treatment period, 1 hour after the morning dose of olanzapine, cimetidine or placebo. This dose is equivalent to 276.5 mg of anhydrous theophlline.

description:

In the nonsmoking men-only study, 10 of 11 subjects completed the study. One subject was withdrawn because of reports of several adverse events (cause not documented) before receiving the study drug. The mean (+/-SD) age of the subjects was 33 +/- 9 years, the mean height was 174.2 +/- 7.2 cm, the mean bodyweight was 73.9 +/- 9.3 kg and the mean BMI was 24.3 +/- 2.0 kg/m2. All subjects were Caucasian. In the nonsmoking women-only study, 18 of 20 subjects completed the study. Two subjects were withdrawn; one had mild to moderate adverse events related to duloxetine administration, and the other, who received only placebo, had poor venous access. The mean (+/-SD) age of the subjects was 38.2 +/- 9.8 years, the mean height was 166.5 +/- 7 cm, the mean bodyweight was 75.3 +/- 10 kg and the mean BMI was 27.1 +/- 2.8 kg/m2. Sixty percent of the subjects were Caucasian and the rest were African American.

METHODS:
The separate studies in women and men were designed identically as single-centre, subject-blind, randomized, two-way, two-period, balanced crossover studies. Duloxetine was administered in a subject-blind manner, but the infusion of aminophylline was open-label. In each period, duloxetine 60 mg and placebo were given orally twice daily on days 1–4 and once on the morning of day 5. On day 5, theophylline 197.5 mg was given as a 30-minute intravenous infusion of aminophylline 250 mg. Each aminophylline dose was separated by at least 17 days.

RESULTS:
In men, the presence of duloxetine was associated with a small, statistically insignificant increase of 7% in the theophylline C_max and the AUC_inf (table IV). However, in women, there was a statistically significant increase in the theophylline C_max (9%) and the AUC_inf (20%). When the results from both men and women were combined, there was a statistically significant increase in the theophylline AUC_inf (13%) but not in the C_max (7%). Nonetheless, the change in the theophylline AUC_inf in the presence of duloxetine was small, and the 90% CI was within the 0.8–1.25 equivalence range for men, and for men and women combined, but narrowly missed the upper boundary of the equivalence range in women (0.8–1.27)."

description:
Twelve healthy volunteers (8 men and 4 women), aged 20 to 40 years, participated after giving written informed consent. All were active ambulatory non-smoking adults, with no evidence of medical disease and taking no other medications. Female subjects were not taking oral contraceptives and did not have contraceptive implants.
   The study had a double-blind, randomized, 5-way
crossover design, with at least 7 days elapsing between
treatments. Medications were separately and identically
packaged in opaque capsules and administered orally. At 8 AM on study day 1, subjects entered the outpatient Clinical Psychopharmacology Research Unit where they received the initial dose of azole (or
placebo) and remained under observation for 30 minutes. Subjects took a second dose of azole (or placebo) at home at 4 PM on day 1. On the morning of day 2, after ingesting a standardized light breakfast with no caffeine-containing food or beverages and no grapefruit juice, they returned to the Research Unit at approximately 7:30 AM. They fasted until 12 noon, after which they resumed a normal diet (without grapefruit juice or caffeine-containing food or beverages). The third dose of azole (or placebo) was given at 8 AM, and the single dose of zolpidem or placebo was given at 9 AM. A final azole (or placebo) dose was given at 5 PM.
    Coadministration of zolpidem with ketoconazole (treatment C) significantly prolonged zolpidem elimination half-life, increased total AUC, and decreased apparent oral clearance when compared to zolpidem plus placebo (treatment B; Figure 3 and Table II). Zolpidem AUC during treatment C was increased by a factor of 1.83 + 0.24 (mean +/- SE) compared to treatment B values, and clearance during treatment C was reduced to 64% +/- 7% of treatment B values.

SUBJECTS
Twelve healthy male and twelve healthy female subjects aged between 18 and 45 years participated in this three-period crossover study. They were extensively screened within 3 weeks of study entry and had to be medically and mentally healthy, as evidenced by medical history, full physical examination, routine clinical laboratory investigations and ECG. Their body mass index had to be within the range 19-29 kg/m2 and they were not allowed to be smokers. Subjects were screened for being extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 using dextromethorphan as a probe.

Of the 12 males and 12 female subjects enrolled into the study, three subjects (1 male, 2 females) discontinued the study due to the emergence of adverse events on days 21, 23, and 27, respectively, of the 27 day treatment period.

METHODS
Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. They were randomly assigned to one of six treatment sequences in this three-period crossover study without washout intervals. They were admitted to the clinical pharmacology institute two days before the start of the study. In order to mimic clinical practice as much as possible, paroxetine was administered in the morning and mirtazapine in the evening, with a 12h interval between administrations. From day 1 up to and including day 26 paroxetine 20 or 40 mg or placebo was administered at 9 a.m. and mirtazapine 15 or 30 mg or placebo at 9 p.m. each day.

The treatments used were: (A) 20 mg paroxetine plus one placebo paroxetine capsule at 9 a.m. and two placebo mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the first three days followed by two 20 mg paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and two placebo mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days; (B) two placebo paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and one 15 mg mirtazapine plus one placebo mirtazapine tablet at 9 p.m. for 3 days followed by two placebo paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and two 15 mg mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days; (C) 20 mg paroxetine plus one placebo paroxetine capsule at 9 a.m. and 15 mg mirtazapine plus one placebo mirtazapine tablet at 9 p.m. for 3 days followed by two 20 mg paroxetine at 9 a.m. and two 15 mg mirtazapine at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days. Thus, six possible treatment sequences (TS1 - TS6) were used (Table 1). In those treatment sequences in which either paroxetine or mirtazapine had also been administered in the preceding treatment sequence, the drug was continued at the highest dose, i.e. two 20 mg capsules for paroxetine and two 15 mg tablets for mirtazapine. Two males and two females were randomized to each of the six treatment sequences.

RESULTS

Adding paroxetine to mirtazapine treatment increased the mirtazapine plasma concentrations. The AUC_0-24 increased by approximately 17% during concomitant administration of paxoetine. Statistically significant differences were observed in AUC_0-24 and C_max,av."							DIKB	"08/23/2010 15:39:12

They were extensively screened within 3 weeks of study entry and had to be medically and mentally healthy, as evidenced by medical history, full physical examination, routine clinical laboratory investigations and ECG. Their body mass index had to be within the range 19-29 kg/m2 and they were not allowed to be smokers. Subjects were screened for being extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 using dextromethorphan as a probe.

Of the 12 males and 12 female subjects enrolled into the study, three subjects (1 male, 2 females) discontinued the study due to the emergence of adverse events on days 21, 23, and 27, respectively, of the 27 day treatment period.

METHODS
Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. They were randomly assigned to one of six treatment sequences in this three-period crossover study without washout intervals. They were admitted to the clinical pharmacology institute two days before the start of the study. In order to mimic clinical practice as much as possible, paroxetine was administered in the morning and mirtazapine in the evening, with a 12h interval between administrations. From day 1 up to and including day 26 paroxetine 20 or 40 mg or placebo was administered at 9 a.m. and mirtazapine 15 or 30 mg or placebo at 9 p.m. each day.

The treatments used were: (A) 20 mg paroxetine plus one placebo paroxetine capsule at 9 a.m. and two placebo mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the first three days followed by two 20 mg paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and two placebo mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days; (B) two placebo paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and one 15 mg mirtazapine plus one placebo mirtazapine tablet at 9 p.m. for 3 days followed by two placebo paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and two 15 mg mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days; (C) 20 mg paroxetine plus one placebo paroxetine capsule at 9 a.m. and 15 mg mirtazapine plus one placebo mirtazapine tablet at 9 p.m. for 3 days followed by two 20 mg paroxetine at 9 a.m. and two 15 mg mirtazapine at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days. Thus, six possible treatment sequences (TS1 - TS6) were used (Table 1). In those treatment sequences in which either paroxetine or mirtazapine had also been administered in the preceding treatment sequence, the drug was continued at the highest dose, i.e. two 20 mg capsules for paroxetine and two 15 mg tablets for mirtazapine. Two males and two females were randomized to each of the six treatment sequences.

RESULTS

Adding paroxetine to mirtazapine treatment increased the mirtazapine plasma concentrations. The AUC_0-24 increased by approximately 17% during concomitant administration of paxoetine. Statistically significant differences were observed in AUC_0-24 and C_max,av."		boycer	paroxetine_increases_auc_mirtazapine	0.03	0.04	20

CYP2C19 -- 6 homozygous EMs, 6 heterozygous EMs, and 6 poor metabolizers

ages: 21-34

description:
NOTE: AUC_I/AUC in the DIKB knowledge-base is from the 6 participants classified as homozygous EMs and the value is for the R-enantiomer. The AUC increase for the S-enantiomer was greater; please see the full text. 

Eighteen healthy subjects, of whom six each were homozygous extensive metabolizers (homEMs), heterozygous extensive metabolizers (hetEMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, participated in the study. Each subject received either placebo or fluvoxamine, 25 mg twice daily for 6 days, then a single oral dose of 60 mg of racemic lansoprazole. The plasma concentrations of lansoprazole enantiomers and lansoprazole sulphone were subsequently measured for 24 h post lansoprazole administration using liquid chromatography.

In the homEMs and hetEMs, fluvoxamine significantly increased the AUC(0, inf) and C max and prolonged the elimination half-life of both (R)- and (S)-lansoprazole, whereas in the PMs, the only statistically significant effect of fluvoxamine was on
the AUC(0, inf) for (R)-lansoprazole. The mean fluvoxamine-mediated percent increase in the AUC(0, inf) of (R)-lansoprazole in the homEMs compared with the PMs was significant ( P = 0.0117); however, C max did not differ among the three CYP2C19 genotypes. On the other hand, fluvoxamine induced a significant percent increase in both the AUC(0, inf) and C max for (S)-lansoprazole in the homEMs compared with the hetEMs ( P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0125, respectively) as well as compared with the PMs ( P &lt; 0.0001 for each parameter).

description:
SUBJECTS: Thirteen men entered the study (eight were white, four black, and one mixed ethnicity). The mean (range) age, weight, and height of the patients were 37.5 (21–59) years, 86.7 (49–140) kg, and 177.8 (160–193) cm, respectively. Nine men (69.2%) had schizoaffective disorder, three (23.1%) had bipolar disorder, and one (7.7%) had paranoid schizophrenia. Six patients were withdrawn because of lack of efficacy (N = 2), adverse events (N = 2), and refusal to continue (N = 2). All 13 patients were included in the safety analysis, but only the seven patients who completed the entire study were entered into the pharmacokinetic analysis.

METHODS:   Thirteen men (aged 18–60 years) with selected psychotic disorders were entered into this open-label, non-randomized, escalating-dose, pharmacokinetic trial conducted at a single center.  Psychotropic medications were withdrawn on day, 1 and patients underwent a 2-day washout period. On days 3 to 8, patients received quetiapine in escalating doses from 25 to 150 mg three times daily, at approximately 7 a.m., 3 p.m., and 11 p.m. Quetiapine 150 mg three times daily was then administered on days 9 to 18. The final dose was given on the morning of day 19. Cimetidine 400 mg was initiated on the afternoon of day 15 and was administered three times daily with each dose of quetiapine thereafter.

RESULTS: The mean plasma concentration versus time profiles for quetiapine determined on days 11, 15, and 19 were similar with a slight increase in the mean plasma concentration during coadministration with cimetidine. Using day 15 as baseline, geometric mean steady-state AUC_0–8h and C_max increased by 24% and 19%, respectively, after coadministration with cimetidine (day 19). Using day 11 as baseline, however, increases of only 10% and 4% were detected. In addition, differences between the 2 baseline days (11 and 15) in mean steady-state AUC_0–8h and C_max were 13% and 14%, respectively (intrasubject variability).

The geometric mean quetiapine AUC_0–8h,ss was significantly higher with cimetidine than without compared with day 15 (p=0.002) but not on day 11 (p=0.09). However, variability between the days without cimetidine coadministration (i.e., days 11 and 15) was also significant (p=0.04), with a change of 13% (p=0.04)."							DIKB	"09/16/2010 12:29:46

SUBJECTS: Thirteen men entered the study (eight were white, four black, and one mixed ethnicity). The mean (range) age, weight, and height of the patients were 37.5 (21–59) years, 86.7 (49–140) kg, and 177.8 (160–193) cm, respectively. Nine men (69.2%) had schizoaffective disorder, three (23.1%) had bipolar disorder, and one (7.7%) had paranoid schizophrenia. Six patients were withdrawn because of lack of efficacy (N = 2), adverse events (N = 2), and refusal to continue (N = 2). All 13 patients were included in the safety analysis, but only the seven patients who completed the entire study were entered into the pharmacokinetic analysis.

METHODS:   Thirteen men (aged 18–60 years) with selected psychotic disorders were entered into this open-label, non-randomized, escalating-dose, pharmacokinetic trial conducted at a single center.  Psychotropic medications were withdrawn on day, 1 and patients underwent a 2-day washout period. On days 3 to 8, patients received quetiapine in escalating doses from 25 to 150 mg three times daily, at approximately 7 a.m., 3 p.m., and 11 p.m. Quetiapine 150 mg three times daily was then administered on days 9 to 18. The final dose was given on the morning of day 19. Cimetidine 400 mg was initiated on the afternoon of day 15 and was administered three times daily with each dose of quetiapine thereafter.

RESULTS: The mean plasma concentration versus time profiles for quetiapine determined on days 11, 15, and 19 were similar with a slight increase in the mean plasma concentration during coadministration with cimetidine. Using day 15 as baseline, geometric mean steady-state AUC_0–8h and C_max increased by 24% and 19%, respectively, after coadministration with cimetidine (day 19). Using day 11 as baseline, however, increases of only 10% and 4% were detected. In addition, differences between the 2 baseline days (11 and 15) in mean steady-state AUC_0–8h and C_max were 13% and 14%, respectively (intrasubject variability).

The geometric mean quetiapine AUC_0–8h,ss was significantly higher with cimetidine than without compared with day 15 (p=0.002) but not on day 11 (p=0.09). However, variability between the days without cimetidine coadministration (i.e., days 11 and 15) was also significant (p=0.04), with a change of 13% (p=0.04)."		boycer	cimetidine_increases_auc_quetiapine	0.45	1.2	7

SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy male volunteers aged 18-45 years participated in this study. They were extensively screened within 3 weeks of study entry and had to be medically and mentally healthy, as evidenced by medical history, full physical examination, routine clinical laboratory investigations and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Their body-mass index had to be within the range 19 +/- 29 kg/m2, and they were not allowed to be heavy smokers (less than ten cigarettes or equivalent per day). On admission to the unit, they were screened for alcohol or drug use. No concomitant medication was allowed, with the exception of paracetamol for severe (head)aches.

METHODS: Twelve male subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of two groups in this two-period crossover study, with a medication-free washout interval of at least 2 weeks. For each study period, they were admitted to the clinical pharmacology institute 1 day before the start of the study. After admission, subjects were re-screened for alcohol and drugs. During one treatment period, subjects were given cimetidine (800 mg b.i.d. orally) for 14 days, with mirtazapine (30 mg nocte orally) added from the 6th to the 12th day of this period. During the alternate treatment period, cimetidine tablets were replaced by placebo tablets. Medication was taken together with water. Standard meals and snacks were served at fixed times of day. The use of alcohol was forbidden for 48 h prior to the start of the study and up to 48 h after the last study day. There were restrictions with regard to the use of coffee, tea and chocolate. The daily dosages of mirtazapine (30 mg nocte) and cimetidine (800 mg b.i.d.) were in agreement with the manufacturers' recommendations and coincided with current therapeutic practice.

RESULTS: The combined administration of mirtazapine and cimetidine resulted in a statistically significant increase in AUC_0-24 of mirtazapine compared with the administration of mirtazapine as a single drug (AUC_0-24: 979 versus 635 ng x h/ml)."							DIKB	"09/16/2010 12:05:16

description: Healthy subjects were selected by the investigators based on their medical history, physical examination, ECGs and routine clinical laboratory test results. Up to 18 male smokers (aged 18–65 years) were to be enrolled in the fluvoxamine study. Sixteen men who were smokers were enrolled, and 14 completed the study. Two subjects were withdrawn by the investigator before receiving the study drug. The mean (+/- SD) age of the subjects was 37 +/- 11 years, the mean height was 174 +/- 6 cm, the mean bodyweight was 76.9 +/- 10.6 kg and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.4 +/- 2.9 kg/m2. The majority of subjects were Caucasian (81%) and the rest were African American.

METHODS: This was an open-label, four-period, sequential crossover study. The dosing sequence started with duloxetine administration only (intravenous or oral; dosing periods 1 and 2), followed by duloxetine (intravenous or oral) in the presence of steady-state fluvoxamine (dosing periods 3 and 4). Duloxetine administration was planned on days 1, 5, 14 and 20 and fluvoxamine was administered from days 8 to 24. The sequence of intravenous and oral duloxetine dosing was randomized. The oral dose of duloxetine was a single 60-mg dose and the intravenous dose of duloxetine was a 10-mg infusion over 30 minutes. Fluvoxamine was initiated at a single dose of 50 mg for 1 day followed by 100 mg once daily for at least 16 additional days. Subjects unable to tolerate fluvoxamine 100 mg once daily were discontinued from the study. The washout period between each dose of duloxetine was a minimum of 4 days and a maximum of 14 days.

RESULTS: The oral duloxetine C_max and AUC_inf were increased by 141% (90% CI 93, 200) and 460% (90% CI 359, 584), respectively, whereas the intravenous duloxetine AUC_inf increased by 170% (90% CI 121, 230)."							DIKB	"09/01/2010 15:15:26

Description:
The pharmacokinetic interactions of sertraline and fluoxetine with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine were studied in 18 healthy male volunteers phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan. Concentrations in plasma were determined after 7 days of desipramine (50 mg/day) dosing alone, during the 21 days of desipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) coadministration (fluoxetine, 20 mg/day; sertraline, 50 mg/day), and for 21 days of continued desipramine administration after SSRI discontinuation. Desipramine Cmax was increased 4.0-fold versus 31% and AUC0-24 was increased 4.8-fold versus 23% for fluoxetine versus sertraline, respectively, relative to baseline after 3 weeks of coadministration. Desipramine trough concentrations approached baseline within 1 week of sertraline discontinuation but remained elevated for the 3-week follow-up period after fluoxetine discontinuation. Concentrations of SSRIs and their metabolites correlated significantly with desipramine concentration changes (for fluoxetine/norfluoxetine, r = 0.94 to 0.96; p &lt; 0.001; for sertraline/desmethylsertraline, r = 0.63; p &lt; 0.01).

Description: 
Participants received a 50 mg single dose of either desipramine or imipramine under three conditions: alone, after a single 150 mg dose of sertraline, and after the eighth daily 150 mg dose of sertraline. Plasma samples were analyzed for desipramine or imipramine concentration by HPLC with electrochemical detection, and pharmacokinetics were determined with use of noncompartmental analysis of individual data. RESULTS: Multiple-dose, but not single-dose, treatment with sertraline significantly reduced apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) and prolonged the half-life of desipramine relative to baseline. These changes resulted in higher plasma desipramine concentrations, as indicated by a significant increase in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity [AUC(0-infinity)] (22% and 54%, respectively). Both single- and multiple-dose treatment with sertraline significantly reduced the CL/F of imipramine.

Route of administration: oral

study duration: PK values of a single dose of desipramine was compared with the same values after eight days of treatment with desipramine + sertraline

population: 6 healthy males, all participants were extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (o-demethylation) (c.f. page 154, paragraph 3). 

ages: mean(std dev):42 (9)

AUC_i/AUC (24 hour): 796/516 = 1.54

Description: 
Participants received a 50 mg single dose of either desipramine or imipramine under three conditions: alone, after a single 150 mg dose of sertraline, and after the eighth daily 150 mg dose of sertraline. Plasma samples were analyzed for desipramine or imipramine concentration by HPLC with electrochemical detection, and pharmacokinetics were determined with use of noncompartmental analysis of individual data. RESULTS: Multiple-dose, but not single-dose, treatment with sertraline significantly reduced apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) and prolonged the half-life of desipramine relative to baseline. These changes resulted in higher plasma desipramine concentrations, as indicated by a significant increase in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity [AUC(0-infinity)] (22% and 54%, respectively). Both single- and multiple-dose treatment with sertraline significantly reduced the CL/F of imipramine. This effect was stronger after multiple predoses of sertraline, when imipramine Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) were increased by 39% and 68%, respectively. These treatment effects were consistent between individuals."		boycer	sertraline_increases_auc_desipramine	0.05	0.15	6

SUBJECTS: Six healthy male Japanese volunteers who had given informed consent participated in this study. Their mean age and body weight were 31 +/- 4 years (range, 26-36 years) and 66.3 +/- 5.1 kg (range, 57-72 kg), respectively. Three subjects were nonsmokers and three were smokers (20-40 cigarettes per day). All subjects were in good health as assessed by medical history, physical examination, routine hematology, blood chemistry, urinary tests, and cardiac function (electrocardiography).

STUDY DESIGN: A randomized crossover design with two phases was used. A 7-day washout period separated the two treatment conditions. Each subject received an oral dose of mexiletine (200 mg) at 7:00 AM with 100 mL of water. In the one phase, they received mexiletine alone (study 1); in the other phase, they received fluvoxamine (50 mg twice a day) for 7 days, and on the eighth day they received mexiletine and fluvoxamine concomitantly at 7:00 AM (study 2). Each subject fasted overnight for at least 10 hours before the administration of mexiletine at 7:00 AM and continued to fast for an additional 6 hours after administration. The subjects were instructed not to take any medications or drink anything that included caffeine or alcoholic beverages for 1 week before the study and throughout the study.

RESULTS: The area under the concentration-time curve and serum peak concentration of mexiletine in study 2 were significantly increased compared with those in study 1 (10.4 +/- 4.85 versus 6.70 +/- 3.21 µg x h/mL, P = .006 and 0.623 +/- 0.133 versus 0.536 +/- 0.164 µg/mL, P = .008, respectively).

SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy white subjects, 6 men and 6 women, aged 22 to 45 years (mean, 30 years) and weighing 56 to 94 kg (mean, 81 kg for the men and 69 kg for the women), participated in this study, which included 7 EMs and 5 PMs of debrisoquin. The debrisoquin metabolic ratio (MR) ranged from 0.57 to 2.2 in EMs and from 35 to 260 in PMs. Genotyping of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 was performed in 1 subject (subject No. 12) by the methods of Heim and Meyer (CYP2D6*3 and *4) and de Morais et al (CYP2C19*2). All subjects were healthy as assessed by medical history, physical examination, urine drug screen, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, virologic testing, and routine laboratory analyses. All were nonsmokers and had been drug-free for at least 1 week before the study.
Two EM subjects (subjects No. 1 and No. 4) were not able to participate in period 3 because of travel abroad and, therefore, were replaced by 2 new EMs (subjects No. 12 and No. 13). They also followed the protocol in period 1 before entering period 3.

METHODS: Single oral doses of 100 mg caffeine and 20 mg omeprazole were given separately to 5 EMs and 5 PMs of debrisoquin to assess the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, respectively. Initially, a single oral dose of fluvoxamine (25 mg to PMs and 50 mg to EMs) was given [Period 1], followed by 1 week of daily administration of 25 mg × 2 to EMs and 25 mg × 1 to PMs [Period 2]. Caffeine (day 6) and omeprazole (day 7) were again administered at the steady state of fluvoxamine. Later the study protocol was repeated with a lower dose of fluvoxamine, 10 mg × 2 to EMs and 10 mg × 1 to PMs for 1 week [Period 3]. Concentrations of fluvoxamine, caffeine, omeprazole, and their metabolites were analyzed by HPLC methods in plasma and urine.
Because fluvoxamine kinetics is partly dependent on the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6, we gave double the dose of fluvoxamine to EMs of debrisoquin compared with PMs of debrisoquin to obtain similar plasma concentrations of fluvoxamine.

RESULTS: The geometric means of omeprazole AUC(0-8 h) increased with 174% (P &lt; .001) with 10 mg x 1 or x 2 [Period 3] and 330% (P &lt; .001) with 25 mg x 1 or × 2 of fluvoxamine [Periods 1-2]."							DIKB	"09/15/2010 15:02:35

Erythromycin (500 mg qid) was given from 7 days before through 4 days after the second atorvastatin dose. Atorvastatin concentrations were determined by an enzyme inhibition assay, which measured both atorvastatin and active metabolites. When erythromycin was coadministered with atorvastatin, mean Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) increased by 37.7% and 32.5%, respectively. Mean terminal half-life was similar following each atorvastatin dose.

Each patient met the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, had not previously received CLZ or FLV and had not consumed beverages containing caffeine, alcohol or grapefruit juice for at least 1 month prior to the study. Patients were also not taking any known CYP1A2 inducers or inhibitors or other routinely prescribed medications. Only lorazepam “as needed” 2 mg every 4–6 h was allowed during the study. All patients were evaluated to be physically healthy by physical examination, medical history, and routine hematological, biochemical and urinalysis tests. These patients were not classified as refractory schizophrenics by the criteria proposed by Kane et al. (1988). Prior to the study, these patients were phenotyped with dextromethorphan and all subjects were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 (Lane et al. 1996). Also, prior to the study, these patients were also administered a test dose of caffeine 200 mg and CYP1A2 status was evaluated. Caffeine and metabolite ratios were within values previously reported by other investigators, indicating the absence of any unusual metabolizers of CYP1A2 in this group of patients (Bertilsson et al. 1994).

METHODS: On the first study day at 8:00 a.m., each patient received a single CLZ 50 mg dose (two 25 mg tablets). Venous blood samples (5 ml) were collected in heparinized tubes and obtained prior to the dosage administration and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h post-drug. The blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and the separated plasma frozen at 920°C until assay. FLV 50 mg was administered twice a day to each patient from day 3 to day 16. On day 15, CLZ 50 mg was given as a single dose. Blood samples were obtained at the same times during the first study period.

RESULTS: The total AUC of CLZ increased by a factor of 2.84 upon FLV addition (t = 5.364, P = 0.0007).

description:
SUBJECTS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers were enrolled and 18 (9 men and 9 women) completed the study. The subjects ranged in age from 18 to 41 years (mean 26 years). Weight ranged from 43 to 71 kg (mean 56 kg) for the women and 60 to 83 kg (mean 71 kg) for the
men (Table I). Health status was established on the
basis of medical history, physical examination, and
biochemical laboratory test findings. Subjects         were excluded from entry into the study if these test results were outside the normal ranges and if there was
a history of drug or alcohol abuse. Additional exclusion criteria included: sensitivity to antidepressants or cimetidine; ingestion within the prior 3 months of agents that might alter hepatic enzyme activity; ingestion of any prescription or investigational drug within one month and any nonprescription drug within 2 weeks before the study; excessive tobacco smoking (more than 10 cigarettes/day) or caffeine ingestion (more than 5 cups of coffee/day).
 Of the original 24 volunteers, six did not complete the study. One withdrew from the study for personal reasons unrelated to the drug, and one other participant was dropped from the study because of an infection noticed on day 5, also unrelated to the study drug. Four volunteers withdrew because of apparent drug-related events on days 1 to 3. The symptoms leading to discontinuation included one or more of the following: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, mydriasis, nervousness, tremor, abdominal pain, and headache. The remaining 18 volunteers completed the study.

METHODS: The study was conducted according to an open-label, nonrandomized, cross-over design and lasted 11 days.
The study was divided into two 5-day periods during which the participants resided in a clinical unit, with the exception of a single night in between the two 5-day periods that was spent outside the clinic. The subjects began their stay on the night before the first experimental day. At 8:00 AM of the following morning (day 1), each participant ate a standard, medium fat breakfast consisting of cereal, low-fat milk, one egg, one piece of bacon, one piece of toast with butter, and one glass of orange juice. Thirty minutes later, the participants ingested a single 25-mg tablet of venlafaxine. A multiple oral dose regimen began after this first dose; each participant ingested a single 50-mg tablet of venlafaxine with 8 ounces of water every 8 hours for the next 10 days.
The control period (i.e., no cimetidine) lasted from day 1 through day 5. Subjects fasted overnight before the morning dose on days 5 and 10. The experimental drug interaction phase of the study began on the evening of day 6, when each subject ingested a single 800-mg tablet of cimetidine at 10:00 PM with 8 ounces of water. Venlafaxine dose administration continued during this phase of the study as described above. Once daily cimetidine administration (800 mg/day) continued through day 10, and participants were discharged from the clinical unit on day 11.

RESULTS: Consistent with the above findings, cimetidine produced a significant increase in the C_max, C_min, and AUC of venlafaxine (P &lt; 0.001) but no significant changes in these three parameters for 0-des-methylvenlafaxine."							DIKB	"09/16/2010 13:02:43

Excluded were women who were pregnant, breastfeeding or of childbearing potential without an acceptable contraceptive method; subjects with any significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric illness or history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome or acute dystonic reactions and subjects with a history of allergy to the study treatments or related compounds, or exposure to monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers in the 4 weeks before the study.

The majority of subjects in Study 2 were male (96%), and 64% were white. The mean +/- SD age was 29 +/- 8 years (range 19-44 years), the mean +/- SD weight was 79.5 +/- 8.7 kg (range 60.2-98.6 kg) and the mean +/- SD BMI was 25.3 +/- 2.6 kg/m2 (range 21.6-32.0 kg/m2). Of the subjects who received concomitant medications while taking aripiprazole and venlafaxine, eight received lorazepam for akathisia and five received benztropine for EPS-related AEs.

Of the 25 subjects who received treatment (safety sample), 23 completed treatment with escitalopram monotherapy and received adjunctive aripiprazole. Two subjects discontinued escitalopram monotherapy (investigator’s decision, n = 1; consent withdrawn, n = 1). Six subjects discontinued during adjunctive aripiprazole treatment (AEs, n = 3; consent withdrawn, n = 3) and 17 subjects completed the study (pharmacokinetic sample).

Mean steady-state plasma concentration–time profiles for escitalopram administered alone or in combination with aripiprazole were similar (Figure 1C) with a small effect of aripiprazole 10 mg/day on AUC_TAU (7% increase; Table 2).

YES -- CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 phenotyping - All extensive metabolizers

ages: none given

description:
SUBJECTS: This was an open study of six young healthy male volunteers, all phenotyped as extensive metabolisers of sparteine (CYP2D6) (metabolic ratio &lt; 20) and mephenytoin (CYP2C19) (S/R ratio &lt; 0.5). All volunteers gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the regional ethics committee and the Danish National Board of Health. Before inclusion, all volunteers were screened by physical examination, laboratory tests and electrocardiogram.

METHODS: On study day 1, the volunteers took a single oral dose of 250 mg tolbutamide (CYP2C9) (Tolbutamid ''Dak'', Nycomed DAK, Denmark) at 0800 hours. On study day 2, the volunteers took 100 mg sparteine (CYP2D6) (Depasan, Giulini Pharma, Germany), 100 mg mephenytoin (CYP2C19) (Mesantoin, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, USA) and 200 mg caffeine (CYP1A2) (Koffein ''Dak'', Nycomed DAK) orally at 0800 hours.
On study day 3, following an overnight fast from 2400 hours, the volunteers took a single oral dose of 200 mg quinidine sulfate (Kinidin ''Dak'', Nycomed DAK), equivalent to 511 umol quinidine. The volunteers were allowed normal meals after the blood sample at t = 1 h was drawn. Following a washout period of 6-8 weeks, the volunteers took 100 mg of fluvoxamine (Fevarin, Solvay Duphar, Netherlands) daily at 0800 hours on study days -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The study procedures on days 1-4, above, were repeated. During the study, the volunteers refrained from intake of any other medications, alcohol or grapefruit juice. Consumption of coffee or xanthine-containing foods was not allowed for a period of 48 h before and the 12 h during caffeine testing. The quinidine and the quinidine and fluvoxamine sessions were performed without randomisation of the sequence, justified by only using hard end-points, i.e. drug- and metabolite-concentrations in plasma and urine, in the study.

RESULTS: The total apparent oral clearance of quinidine was calculated as: CLq = Dose / AUCq (0 -&gt; inf). The quinidine total apparent oral clearance, clearance by N-oxidation and by 3-hydroxylation were statistically significantly reduced during fluvoxamine treatment by medians of 29%, 33% and 44%, respectively.

SUBJECTS: Subjects were nonsmokers who were of normal build and had no clinically significant abnormalities. Fifteen subjects (4 females and 11 males) completed the study. Thirteen subjects were Caucasian, 3 were Hispanic, and one was Asian. Ages ranged from 23 to 40 years (mean = 32 +/- 5 years). At admission, mean height was 173 +/- 10 cm and mean weight was 71 +/- 13 kg.

METHODS: The pharmacokinetics of 3 identical single therapeutic doses of olanzapine (5 mg) were determined in 15 healthy nonsmoking volunteers. The first dose of olanzapine was taken alone, the second given after a single oral dose of fluoxetine (60 mg), and the third given after 8 days of treatment with fluoxetine 60 mg, qd. There was an interval of 10 days between olanzapine doses of periods 1 and 2, and at least 15 days between olanzapine doses of periods 2 and 3. During each period, the volunteers remained in the clinical pharmacology unit for 24 hours following the administration of olanzapine.

RESULTS: After single coadministration of fluoxetine, the C_max and AUC_0-inf of olanzapine increased by 18%, whereas the total apparent clearance decreased by 15%.

description:
SUBJECTS: The study was carried out as an open, randomized, crossover study of 12 volunteers, all men with a median age of 23 years (range, 22-30 years). All were nonsmokers and had no known heart, liver, or kidney diseases according to clinical investigation, clinical chemical/hematological screening, and ECG test. They were not consuming alcohol or drugs on a regular basis at the time of the study. The volunteers consented to participate in the study on the basis of written and verbal information, and the study was approved by the regional ethics committee of the counties of Vejle and Funen and by the Danish National Board of Health.

METHODS: The volunteers were randomized into three groups. All three groups went through three testing periods, which were separated by 2 weeks of washout. In all three periods, the volunteers abstained from ingesting methylxanthine-containing beverages, foods, and medication for 3 days before study and until the last blood sample was drawn. In period A, a blood sample was drawn before intake of a tablet of 300 mg theophylline ethylenediamine (Teofylamin; Nycomed DAK, Copenhagen, Denmark), containing 257 mg theophylline. In period B, the volunteers received a tablet of 50 mg fluvoxamine (Solvay Duphar BV, Weesp, the Netherlands) for 1 day, and during the following 6 days they received 100 mg fluvoxamine each day. On day 4, a blood sample was drawn before the intake of 300 mg theophylline ethylenediamine; thereafter, blood samples were drawn at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48, 72, and 96 h.

RESULTS: The total theophylline clearance was calculated as EQUATION 1 [Cl_13DMX = Dose / AUC_13DMX(total)] where Cl is clearance and AUC_13DMX(total) is the area under the plasma concentration time curve calculated by the trapezoidal rule with extrapolation from the last measurable concentration to infinity.

Description: 
The pharmacokinetics of desipramine when coadministered with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine and sertraline were studied in 24 healthy male volunteers (CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers). Desipramine (50 mg/day) was administered for 23 days in each phase of the crossover study with a 7-day drug-free period between phases. In addition, subjects were randomly assigned to receive concomitant paroxetine (20 mg/day on days 8 through 17 followed by 30 mg/day on days 18 through 20) or sertraline (50 mg/day on days 8 through 17 and 100 mg/day on days 18 through 20). SSRI treatments were switched between phases. After 10 days of coadministration at the lower dose, mean desipramine maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax) relative to baseline increased from 37.8 to 173 ng/mL (+358%) with paroxetine versus from 36.1 to 51.9 ng/mL (+44%) with sertraline; the mean desipramine 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC[24]) increased from 634 to 3,305 ng x h/mL (+421%) with paroxetine versus from 611 to 838 ng x h/mL (+37%) with sertraline; and the mean desipramine trough value (C0) increased from 18.5 to 113 ng/mL (+511%) with paroxetine versus from 18.3 to 21.8 ng/mL (+19%) with sertraline (all increases, p &lt; 0.001). An approximately 10-fold increase in the Cmax and AUC(24) of paroxetine and an approximately 2-fold increase in these parameters for sertraline occurred simultaneously with the desipramine concentration changes. Thus, when coadministered with 50 mg/day desipramine, sertraline had significantly less pharmacokinetic interaction than paroxetine with desipramine at the recommended starting dosages of 50 mg/day and 20 mg/day, respectively."

SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers aged 22 to 27 years (weight range, 67-95 kg; body mass index range, 21-26 kg/m2) participated in this study after having given written informed consent. The subjects were ascertained to be in good health by medical history, a full clinical examination, and standard hematologic and blood chemical laboratory tests before enrollment.
METHODS: This study was an open crossover study with 3 phases. Between phases 1 and 2, there was a 1-week-long washout period, and between phases 2 and 3, there was a washout period of 2 weeks. The first phase was a control period, in which all volunteers received a single oral dose of bupropion (Zyban sustained release, 150 mg; GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, United Kingdom). In the second and third phases the volunteers received a 4-day-long oral antiplatelet agent pretreatment in randomized balanced order with either clopidogrel (Plavix, 75 mg once daily; Sanofi Synthelabo, Guildford, United Kingdom) or ticlopidine
(Ticlid, 250 mg twice daily; Sanofi Synthelabo). On day 4, 1 hour after the last dose of the antiplatelet agent, a single 150-mg dose of bupropion was administered. Venous blood samples (10 mL each) for determination of bupropion and hydroxybupropion concentrations were taken just before and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after administration of bupropion. In all phases the volunteers fasted for 8 hours before
and 4 hours after administration of bupropion. Identical meals were provided on the 3 study days. Volunteers were also required to refrain from strenuous physical exercise, alcohol- or caffeine-containing drinks, smoking, grapefruit juice, and other medications for 2 days before and after study drug administration.
RESULTS: Both of the thienopyridine

Eighteen healthy Japanese volunteers (9 men and 9 women) who were H. pylori-negative were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 25.1 +/- 3.8 years and mean body weight was 56.6 +/- 13.3 kg. Most subjects in this study had participated in our previous studies. The mutated alleles for CYP2C19, CYP2C19*3(*3), and CYP2C19*2(*2) had been identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods of De Morais et al, before this study. The CYP2C19 genotype analyses revealed 5 different patterns as follows: *1/*1 in 6, *1/*2 in 3, *1/*3 in 3, *2/*2 in 5, and *2/*3 in 1. These were divided into 3 groups, homozygous EMs (*1/*1, n=6), heterozygous EMs (*1/*2 and *1/*3, n=6), and PMs (*2/*2 and *2/*3, n=6).
METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study design in 3 phases was conducted at intervals of 2 weeks. Clarithromycin (400 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of 2 tablets, fluvoxamine (25 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of a tablet, or matched placebo was given orally twice a day (9 AM, 9 PM) for 6 days. Six volunteers within each group were allocated to each of the 3 different drug sequences: placebo-clarithromycin-fluvoxamine, fluvoxamine-placebo-clarithromycin, or clarithromycin-fluvoxamine-placebo. On day 6, they took a single oral 60-mg dose of lansoprazole with 400 mg dose of clarithromycin, 25mg dose of fluvoxamine, or placebo after overnight fasting (9 AM). No other medications were taken during the study periods. No meal was allowed until 4 hours after the dosing (1 PM). The use of alcohol, tea, coffee, and cola was forbidden during the test days.
RESULTS: Clarithromycin treatment significantly increased Cmax and AUC_0-24 of lansoprazole in heterozygous EMs (P&lt;0.05) and in PMs (P&lt;0.01), and prolonged elimination half-life by 1.6-fold (P&lt;0.05) in PMs. Calculated from Table 1, the AUC_i/AUC were: 1.62 (homozygous EMs), 1.71 (heterozygous EMs [p&lt;0.05]), and 1.89 (PMs [p&lt;0.01])."

description: Ten healthy, nonsmoking volunteers (6 male and 4 female), aged 21–47 years, initiated participation after giving written informed consent. All were active, ambulatory adults, with no evidence of medical disease and taking no other medication. The ethnic distribution was: 7 Caucasian, 2 African-American, 1 Hispanic.

METHODS: The study was a randomized, double blind, 5-way crossover study with at least 7 days elapsing between trials. Medications were: trazodone hydrochloride, 50 mg (Desyrel; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ); zolpidem tartrate, 5 mg (Ambien; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ); and clarithromycin, 500 mg (Biaxin; Abbott, North Chicago, IL). The five treatment conditions were: (i) placebo + placebo, (ii) zolpidem + placebo, (iii) zolpidem + clarithromycin, (iv) trazodone + placebo, and (v) trazodone + clarithromycin. All medications were identically packaged in opaque capsules (void space filled with sucrose) and administered orally. Subjects were given 500 mg doses of clarithromycin (or matching placebo) at approximately 24 h, 8 h, and 1 h prior to, and again at 8 h after, administration of zolpidem, trazodone, or placebo.

At 7 am on the study day, subjects were admitted to the Clinical Psychopharmacology Research Unit at Tufts University School of Medicine. They ingested a light breakfast with no caffeine containing beverages or food, and no grapefruit juice. The 500 mg dose of clarithromycin (or matching placebo) was administered with 200 ml of tap water. One hour later, subjects took a “challenge” dose of 5 mg zolpidem, 50 mg of trazodone, or placebo with 200 ml tap water. Volunteers resumed a normal diet at noon (without caffeine).

Venous blood samples were drawn into heparinized tubes prior to challenge dosing and at postdosage times of 1/2, 1, 1 1/2, 2, 2 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 h. Another 500 mg of clarithromycin or placebo was given following the 8-h blood sample. The subjects were then discharged from the study unit. They returned the next morning for a 24-h blood sample. All blood samples were centrifuged, and the plasma was separated and frozen until the time of the assay.

RESULTS: Coadministration of trazodone with clarithromycin compared to placebo significantly increased peak plasma concentration (C_max) (681 ng/ml vs. 922 ng/ml), prolonged t_1/2 (7.1 h vs. 13.9 h), increased AUC (4,668 ng/ml x h vs. 9,275 ng/ml x h), and reduced oral clearance (166 ml/min vs. 89 ml/min)."

route of administration: oral

study duration: 2 days

population: 10 healthy, nonsmoking volunteers (6 male, 4 female); 7 Caucasian, 2 African-American, 1 Hispanic

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms? No.

ages: 21-47

description: Ten healthy, nonsmoking volunteers (6 male and 4 female), aged 21–47 years, initiated participation after giving written informed consent. All were active, ambulatory adults, with no evidence of medical disease and taking no other medication. The ethnic distribution was: 7 Caucasian, 2 African-American, 1 Hispanic.

METHODS: The study was a randomized, double blind, 5-way crossover study with at least 7 days elapsing between trials. Medications were: trazodone hydrochloride, 50 mg (Desyrel; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ); zolpidem tartrate, 5 mg (Ambien; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ); and clarithromycin, 500 mg (Biaxin; Abbott, North Chicago, IL). The five treatment conditions were: (i) placebo + placebo, (ii) zolpidem + placebo, (iii) zolpidem + clarithromycin, (iv) trazodone + placebo, and (v) trazodone + clarithromycin. All medications were identically packaged in opaque capsules (void space filled with sucrose) and administered orally. Subjects were given 500 mg doses of clarithromycin (or matching placebo) at approximately 24 h, 8 h, and 1 h prior to, and again at 8 h after, administration of zolpidem, trazodone, or placebo.

At 7 am on the study day, subjects were admitted to the Clinical Psychopharmacology Research Unit at Tufts University School of Medicine. They ingested a light breakfast with no caffeine containing beverages or food, and no grapefruit juice. The 500 mg dose of clarithromycin (or matching placebo) was administered with 200 ml of tap water. One hour later, subjects took a “challenge” dose of 5 mg zolpidem, 50 mg of trazodone, or placebo with 200 ml tap water. Volunteers resumed a normal diet at noon (without caffeine).

Venous blood samples were drawn into heparinized tubes prior to challenge dosing and at postdosage times of 1/2, 1, 1 1/2, 2, 2 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 h. Another 500 mg of clarithromycin or placebo was given following the 8-h blood sample. The subjects were then discharged from the study unit. They returned the next morning for a 24-h blood sample. All blood samples were centrifuged, and the plasma was separated and frozen until the time of the assay.

RESULTS: Coadministration of trazodone with clarithromycin compared to placebo significantly increased peak plasma concentration (C_max) (681 ng/ml vs. 922 ng/ml), prolonged t_1/2 (7.1 h vs. 13.9 h), increased AUC (4,668 ng/ml x h vs. 9,275 ng/ml x h), and reduced oral clearance (166 ml/min vs. 89 ml/min)."		boycer	clarithromycin_increases_auc_trazodone	0.05	0.5	10

route of administration: oral

study duration: 6 days

population: 12 healthy volunteers (all male), all Japanese

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms? No

ages: 20-28

description: Twelve healthy Japanese male volunteers were enrolled in this study. Their mean age (+/- SD) was 24.0 +/- 2.0 years (range, 20-28 years), and their mean body weight was 64.8 +/- 6.2 kg (range, 53-86 kg).

METHODS: A randomized crossover study design was conducted at intervals of 4 weeks. Two 40-mg tablets of verapamil (Vasolan; Eisai Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) 3 times daily (at 8 AM, 1 PM, and 6 PM) or matched placebo with 240 mL of tap water was given for 6 days. The volunteers took a single oral 1-mg dose of risperidone at 9 AM on day 6 with 240 mL of tap water.

RESULTS: The total AUC of risperidone during verapamil treatment was higher than during placebo by 1.82-fold (95% CI, 1.24- to 2.82-fold).
