This folder contains the output MP & NP graphs

(1) data/mp-graphs contains initial-dikb-mp-oa.xml as original MP graph that holding claim, data, method, etc.

Load initial-dikb-mp-oa.xml into protege, run inference engine to export "inferred-graph-oa-mp.xml" as final version of MP graph which is ready to upload to virtuoso endpoint. 

The reason that MP graph require inference is because MP sub types for mp:Claim, mp:Data, mp:Method, etc, have abstract type that needs to be inferred as translative relationship. (ex. data item have type "Non_Tracable_Statement_Data" is subclass of "mp:Data", protege inference engine will add rdf.type mp:Data for data item.)

"processed-dikb-ddis.tsv" is MP data in tsv file which could be data inputs for MP graph creating program. It benefits for add missing cell to recreate MP graph.  

(2) data/np-graphs holds nanopublication graphs... this folder has a README.md that elaborates on their functions and purpose

All of files need to be uploaded to single endpoint
