This folder contains the output MP & NP graphs

(1) data/mp-graphs contains initial-dikb-mp-oa.xml as original MP graph that holding claim, data, method, etc.

Load initial-dikb-mp-oa.xml into protege, run inference engine to export "inferred-graph-oa-mp.xml" as final version of MP graph which is ready to upload to virtuoso endpoint. 

The reason that MP graph require inference is because MP sub types for mp:Claim, mp:Data, mp:Method, etc, have abstract type that needs to be inferred as translative relationship. (ex. data item have type "Non_Tracable_Statement_Data" is subclass of "mp:Data", protege inference engine will add rdf.type mp:Data for data item.)

"processed-dikb-ddis.tsv" is MP data in tsv file which could be data inputs for MP graph creating program. It benefits for add missing cell to recreate MP graph.  

(2) data/np-graphs holds nanopublication graphs... this folder has a README.md that elaborates on their functions and purpose

All of files need to be uploaded to single endpoint

(3) drug URI mappings (Drugbank URI to ChEBI)

In old DIKB, we have 162 drug entities. 145 have Drugbank URI assigned and 17 URIs are missing

Endpoint:
https://dbmi-icode-01.dbmi.pitt.edu/dikb/snorql/

Query:
  SELECT count(distinct *) WHERE {
    ?drug rdf:type ncbit:Pharmacologic_Substance;
    rdfs:label ?label.
    OPTIONAL { ?drug owl:sameAs ?drugURI}
} 

Manually add missing mappings of drugbank and ChEBI:

DB00243 - Ranolazine (recently added by ChEBI at our request)
DB00976 - Telithromycin
DB01623 - Thiothixene
DB00745 - Modafinil
DB00503 - Ritonavir


(4) mapping file "chebi_mapping.txt" comes from query ChEBI Java based API "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/webServices.do"

Manually add missing URIs below:
  
valproate	 https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:60654
r-citalopram	 https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:36792
desvenlafaxine(under O-desmethylvenlafaxine)	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:83527
iloperidone	     https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:65173

(5) For motabolites, we will have to figure out a workaround for entities belows:
hydroxybupropion
desacetyldiltiazem
n-desalkylquetiapine
r-demethylcitalopram
s-demethylcitalopram
dehydro-aripiprazole
beta-hydroxy-simvastatin
