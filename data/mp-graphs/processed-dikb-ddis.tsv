description:
SUBJECTS: The study was carried out as an open, randomized, crossover design. The participants were 14 volunteers; all of the participants were men with a median age of 26 years (range, 21 to 30 years). The subjects had no known heart, liver, or kidney disease according to a clinical examination, clinical chemical and hematologic screening, and electrocardiogram. No participants consumed alcohol or drugs on a regular basis at the time of the study. The volunteers consented to participate in the study on the basis of oral and written information.

METHODS: The study was divided into two periods. In period A, all volunteers took 500 mg of tolbutamide (Tolbutamide “DAK”, Nycomed Denmark, Roskilde, Denmark) as a single oral dose. In period B, the volunteers were randomly assigned to two fluvoxamine groups. One group took 150 mg/d of fluvoxamine (Fevarin 100-mg tablets, Solvay Duphar BV, Weesp, The
Netherlands) for 5 days with a single oral dose of 500 mg of tolbutamide. The other group took a dose of 75 mg of fluvoxamine for 5 days and a single oral dose of 500 mg of tolbutamide. Period A and period B were separated by at least 1 week. Fluvoxamine was given at 20.00 hours.

RESULTS: Total tolbutamide (TB) clearance (CL_TB) was calculated as follows: CL_TB = Dose/AUC in which AUC is the area under the plasma concentration-time curve calculated by means of the trapezoidal rule with extrapolation from the last measurable concentration to infinity. Complete absorption of tolbutamide from the intestine was assumed.

The mean plasma concentration of tolbutamide versus time after a single oral dose of 500 mg of tolbutamide before (period A) and during (period B) concomitant intake of 150 mg/d or 75 mg/d of fluvoxamine is shown in Fig 2. The results of the pharmacokinetic analysis are listed in Table I. Thus the median values of the total clearance of tolbutamide were 845 and 962 mL/h in the group that received 75 mg and the group that received 150 mg, respectively, before the administration of fluvoxamine. During fluvoxamine intake, the clearance values decreased to 688 and 642 mL/h, respectively, and the decrease was statistically significant both in the group that received 75 mg and in the entire group (75 mg and 150 mg) but not in the group that received 150 mg alone. The picture was even more clear for the hydroxylation clearance, for which there was a statistically significant reduction as judged from 95% confidence intervals for the median difference not comprising zero both in the 75-mg and 150-mg fluvoxamine groups. There was a tendency toward a more marked reduction in the latter group, although the difference between the two groups (150 mg versus 75 mg in period B) did not reach a level of statistical significance (Table I).

See Table I and the equation CL_TB = Dose/AUC for more information. The AUC_i/AUC for the 150mg dose was 1.50 and for the 75mg dose was 1.22."	0.5	0.15	14

This study investigated the potential for azithromycin and clarithromycin to inhibit the metabolism of atorvastatin. Although there was no interaction between azithromycin and atorvastatin, clarithromycin did have a significant effect on atorvastatin pharmacokinetic parameters. When coadministered, clarithromycin raised subject exposure (AUC24) by 82% and peak plasma concentrations by 56%. These data suggest that while azithromycin appears to be safe to coadminister with atorvastatin, clarithromycin should be avoided in patients taking this and similarly metabolized HMG-CoA inhibitors."	0.01	0.5	36

Description:
This study was conducted to determine the potential for an interaction between nefazodone, a new antidepressant, and alprazolam after single- and multiple-dose administration in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in 48 healthy male volunteers. A group of 12 subjects received either placebo twice daily, 1 mg of alprazolam twice daily, 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily, or the combination of 1 mg of alprazolam and 200 mg of nefazodone twice daily for 7 days. Serial blood samples were collected after dosing on day 1 and day 7 and before the morning dose on days 4, 5, and 6 for the determination of alprazolam and its metabolites alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (AOH) and 4-hydroxyalprazolam (4OH) and nefazodone and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone (HO-nefazodone), m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), and a triazole dione metabolite (dione) by validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Steady-state levels in plasma were reached by day 4 for alprazolam, 4OH, nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, mCPP, and dione. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis showed that at steady state, alprazolam Cmax and AUCtau values significantly increased approximately twofold and 4OH Cmax and AUCtau values significantly decreased by 40 and 26%, respectively, when nefazodone was coadministered with alprazolam. There was no effect of alprazolam on the single-dose or steady-state pharmacokinetics of nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, or dione after the coadministration of alprazolam and nefazodone.

description:
Eighteen healthy Japanese volunteers (9 men and 9 women) who were H. pylori-negative were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 25.1 +/- 3.8 years and mean body weight was 56.6 +/- 13.3 kg. Most subjects in this study had participated in our previous studies. The mutated alleles for CYP2C19, CYP2C19*3(*3), and CYP2C19*2(*2) had been identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods of De Morais et al, before this study. The CYP2C19 genotype analyses revealed 5 different patterns as follows: *1/*1 in 6, *1/*2 in 3, *1/*3 in 3, *2/*2 in 5, and *2/*3 in 1. These were divided into 3 groups, homozygous EMs (*1/*1, n=6), heterozygous EMs (*1/*2 and *1/*3, n=6), and PMs (*2/*2 and *2/*3, n=6).
METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study design in 3 phases was conducted at intervals of 2 weeks. Clarithromycin (400 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of 2 tablets, fluvoxamine (25 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of a tablet, or matched placebo was given orally twice a
day (9 AM, 9 PM) for 6 days. Six volunteers within each group were allocated to each of the 3 different drug sequences: placebo-clarithromycin-fluvoxamine, fluvoxamine-placebo-clarithromycin, or clarithromycin-fluvoxamine-placebo. On day 6, they took a single oral 60-mg dose of lansoprazole with 400 mg dose of clarithromycin, 25mg dose of fluvoxamine, or placebo after overnight fasting (9 AM). No other medications were taken during the study periods. No meal was allowed until 4 hours after the dosing (1 PM). The use of alcohol, tea, coffee, and cola was forbidden during the test days.
RESULTS: Clarithromycin treatment significantly increased Cmax and AUC_0-24 of lansoprazole in heterozygous EMs (P&lt;0.05) and in PMs (P&lt;0.01), and prolonged elimination half-life by 1.6-fold (P&lt;0.05) in PMs. Calculated from Table 1, the AUC_i/AUC were: 1.62 (homozygous EMs), 1.71 (heterozygous EMs [p&lt;0.05]), and 1.89 (PMs [p&lt;0.01])."	0.06	0.8	18

This was a balanced, randomized, open-label, 4-way crossover study in 10 healthy volunteers, with a 2-week washout period between the phases. Study arms were (1) administration of a single dose of 20 mg lovastatin, (2) administration of a single dose of 20 mg pravastatin, (3) administration of a single dose of lovastatin after administration of 120 mg diltiazem twice a day for 2 weeks, and (4) administration of a single dose of pravastatin after administration of 120 mg diltiazem twice a day for 2 weeks. RESULTS: Diltiazem significantly (P &lt; .05) increased the oral area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) of lovastatin from 3607 +/- 1525 ng/ml/min (mean +/- SD) to 12886 +/- 6558 ng/ml/min and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) from 6 +/- 2 to 26 +/- 9 ng/ml but did not influence the elimination half-life.

SUBJECTS: 11 subjects received fluoxetine treatment (n = 4 placebo first, n = 7 alprazolam first).

METHODS: The study had a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design. Subjects attended 4 study sessions; the first 2 study sessions occurred in the absence of SSRI medications, while the final 2 sessions occurred after a minimum of 21 days of administration of SSRI medication (citalopram 20 mg or fluoxetine 20 mg). Study sessions took place at least 3 days apart. At each study session, subjects were randomly assigned to a single oral dose of alprazolam (1 mg) or placebo at 9:00 am in the morning (ie, 1 of each for the 2 sessions before SSRI administration and 1 of each for the final 2 sessions after SSRI administration). During the post-SSRI study sessions, daily SSRI dosing was continued, while blood samples were collected up to 48.0 hours (ie, SSRIs were administered at 24.0 and 48.0 hours after single-dose alprazolam administration). Trough citalopram, fluoxetine, and metabolite serum concentrations were determined on 5 occasions: on days 1 and 7 of SSRI administration, prior to alprazolam/placebo administration at study sessions 3 and 4, and 7 days after discontinuation of study medications. During the study sessions, a small standardized breakfast (bagel and apple juice) was provided 1 hour postalprazolam administration, and a sandwich and apple juice was provided 4 hours postalprazolam administration. From 8 hours postalprazolam administration, food intake was not regulated. Subjects were instructed not to consume grapefruit juice during the study due to the potential for inhibition of the CYP3A4 enzyme.

RESULTS: Coadministration with fluoxetine significantly increased alprazolam AUC for all time intervals: 0-3 hours (P &lt; 0.05), 0-8 hours (P &lt; 0.005), 0-48 hours (P &lt; 0.001), and 0-inf ( P &lt; 0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 1). The AUC 0-inf increased by 31.8% postfluoxetine.

SUBJECTS: Thirty healthy male (22) and female (8) volunteers participated in the study. Informed consent was obtained for all subjects. Mean (range) age, weight, and height for the subjects were 29.6 years (19-45 years), 78.3 kg (46-102 kg), and 179 cm (158-198 cm), respectively.

Twenty-eight of the 30 enrolled subjects completed the study. Two male subjects withdrew their consent, one on Day 8 during a morning clinic visit and the other on Day 12 before the morning dose of venlafaxine. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were evaluated for only 24 subjects. Four subjects were excluded from the analyses because of protocol violations. Two male subjects did not collect complete 96-hour urine samples, and 2 female subjects consumed
xanthene-containing foods or beverages during the study.

METHODS: This was an open-label drug interaction study to evaluate the effects of steady-state venlafaxine on the pharmacokinetic disposition of single oral doses of
risperidone. Single 1 mg doses of risperidone (1 mg Risperdal® tablet, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Titusville, NJ) were administered on Days 1 and 11 with 180 mL of room-temperature water at approximately 10 a.m. following an overnight fast. Multiple doses of venlafaxine (37.5 mg and 75 mg Effexor® tablets, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Radnor, PA) were administered as follows: 37.5 mg bid from Days 5 through 7 and then 75 mg twice daily from Days 8 through 14. Venlafaxine doses were administered with approximately 240 mL of room- temperature water at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. with food
(except during the designated fasting period on Day
11). Single-dose pharmacokinetic profiles of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone and the total active moiety were evaluated on Days 1 through 5 (risperidone alone) and on Days 11 through 15 (risperidone plus venlafaxine).

description:
SUBJECTS: Patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major affective disorders were admitted to the 3-West Clinical Research Unit of the Biological Psychiatry Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland. Patients volunteered to participate in the clinical research program and gave oral and written informed consent for clinical trials of CBZ, VPA, and BUP, as well as other medications and associated research procedures. A thorough medical and neurologic history and examination and a pretreatment electroencephalogram were done to rule out the presence of seizure disorders and other medical illnesses. A detailed life course of illness was visually plotted and quantified for each patient as previously described. Psychiatric diagnoses were confirmed by the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia structured diagnostic interview. Thus, these patients were carefully characterized as having primary mood disorders (for the purpose of assessing clinical responses to medications) and lacking concurrent medical disorders that could alter pharmacokinetics. 

Patients and nursing staff were blind to chronic medications, as well as to the pharmacokinetic study drug being administered, in order to allow a more objective assessment of clinical responses. The blind condition was also maintained with patients and nurses by having blind &quot;CBZ&quot; and &quot;VPA&quot; concentrations drawn throughout the hospitalization, even at times when patients were not receiving either drug.

METHODS: Patients had 24-hour pharmacokinetic profiles of BUP and metabolites after single oral doses of BUP, 150 mg, while receiving placebo (N = 17) or during chronic CBZ (N = 12) or VPA (N = 5) monotherapy. Patients were on CBZ and VPA for at least 3 weeks in order to allow dosage titration and the attainment of steady state, as well as the full induction of hepatic metabolism with CBZ. The placebo, CBZ, and VPA groups did not differ significantly with respect to mean age (placebo, 38.5 +/- 10.2; CBZ, 35.4 +/- 8.7; VPA, 40.4 +/- 11.5) or gender (placebo, eight men and nine women; CBZ, seven men and five women; VPA two men and three women). Seven patients had both placebo and CBZ studies, and four patients had both placebo and VPA studies. Patients on VPA received a mean dose of 1,750 +/- 866 mg/day with a mean trough VPA concentration in plasma of 97 +/- 19 micro gram/ml. Single trough CBZ and VPA concentrations in plasma were determined during the week of the kinetic study for each patient on these agents.

For each pharmacokinetic study, a single oral dose of BUP, 150 mg, was administered at 9 a.m. in a blind fashion. Patients had nothing by mouth from 11:30 p.m. the night before until 3 hours after receiving the blind BUP dose, at which point they resumed their blinded placebo, CBZ, or VPA and their usual oral intake of food and fluids. Patients were receiving CBZ and VPA in three or four divided doses each day and missed at most a single morning dose of CBZ or VPA, so that the concentrations of these agents in plasma were maintained during the kinetic studies.

RESULTS: VPA increased H-BUP C_max by 56% (p &lt; 0.09) and H-BUP AUC by 94% (p &lt; 0.02).

description:

In the nonsmoking men-only study, 10 of 11 subjects completed the study. One subject was withdrawn because of reports of several adverse events (cause not documented) before receiving the study drug. The mean (+/-SD) age of the subjects was 33 +/- 9 years, the mean height was 174.2 +/- 7.2 cm, the mean bodyweight was 73.9 +/- 9.3 kg and the mean BMI was 24.3 +/- 2.0 kg/m2. All subjects were Caucasian. In the nonsmoking women-only study, 18 of 20 subjects completed the study. Two subjects were withdrawn; one had mild to moderate adverse events related to duloxetine administration, and the other, who received only placebo, had poor venous access. The mean (+/-SD) age of the subjects was 38.2 +/- 9.8 years, the mean height was 166.5 +/- 7 cm, the mean bodyweight was 75.3 +/- 10 kg and the mean BMI was 27.1 +/- 2.8 kg/m2. Sixty percent of the subjects were Caucasian and the rest were African American.

METHODS:
The separate studies in women and men were designed identically as single-centre, subject-blind, randomized, two-way, two-period, balanced crossover studies. Duloxetine was administered in a subject-blind manner, but the infusion of aminophylline was open-label. In each period, duloxetine 60 mg and placebo were given orally twice daily on days 1–4 and once on the morning of day 5. On day 5, theophylline 197.5 mg was given as a 30-minute intravenous infusion of aminophylline 250 mg. Each aminophylline dose was separated by at least 17 days.

RESULTS:
In men, the presence of duloxetine was associated with a small, statistically insignificant increase of 7% in the theophylline C_max and the AUC_inf (table IV). However, in women, there was a statistically significant increase in the theophylline C_max (9%) and the AUC_inf (20%). When the results from both men and women were combined, there was a statistically significant increase in the theophylline AUC_inf (13%) but not in the C_max (7%).

description:
Twelve healthy volunteers (8 men and 4 women), aged 20 to 40 years, participated after giving written informed consent. All were active ambulatory non-smoking adults, with no evidence of medical disease and taking no other medications. Female subjects were not taking oral contraceptives and did not have contraceptive implants.
   The study had a double-blind, randomized, 5-way
crossover design, with at least 7 days elapsing between
treatments. Medications were separately and identically
packaged in opaque capsules and administered orally. At 8 AM on study day 1, subjects entered the outpatient Clinical Psychopharmacology Research Unit where they received the initial dose of azole (or
placebo) and remained under observation for 30 minutes. Subjects took a second dose of azole (or placebo) at home at 4 PM on day 1. On the morning of day 2, after ingesting a standardized light breakfast with no caffeine-containing food or beverages and no grapefruit juice, they returned to the Research Unit at approximately 7:30 AM. They fasted until 12 noon, after which they resumed a normal diet (without grapefruit juice or caffeine-containing food or beverages). The third dose of azole (or placebo) was given at 8 AM, and the single dose of zolpidem or placebo was given at 9 AM. A final azole (or placebo) dose was given at 5 PM.
    Coadministration of zolpidem with ketoconazole (treatment C) significantly prolonged zolpidem elimination half-life, increased total AUC, and decreased apparent oral clearance when compared to zolpidem plus placebo (treatment B; Figure 3 and Table II). Zolpidem AUC during treatment C was increased by a factor of 1.83 + 0.24 (mean +/- SE) compared to treatment B values, and clearance during treatment C was reduced to 64% +/- 7% of treatment B values.

population: 9 healthy Chinese volunteers (7 male, 2 female), all nonsmokers and non-drinkers

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms?
YES -- CYP2D6 phenotyping - All classified as extensive metabolizers

ages: 24-46

description:
SUBJECTS: Nine healthy Chinese volunteers (seven men and two women) were included in the study. The ages ranged from 24 to 46 years and their weights ranged 50 to 75 kg. All subjects were healthy as assessed by a physical examination, an ECG, and blood biochemistry testing. None of the subjects smoked tobacco or drank alcohol. All subjects abstained from drugs for at least 2 weeks before and during the study. Subjects were excluded if they were receiving any medications known to induce or inhibit cytochrome P450. Pregnant women were excluded by a test for serum human chorionic gonadotropin. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Medical University (Nanjing, China). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

CYP2D6 phenotype: The urinary molar metabolic ratio (MR) of the subjects was calculated by use of the equation: [MR = Dextromethorphan (mg/L)/dextrorphan (mg/L) x 0.948]. Phenotype was determined on the basis of an MR value according to the method of Schmid et al. Any subject with an MR &gt;0.3 was classified as a poor metabolizer; subjects with MR values &lt;=0.3 were classified as an extensive metabolizer.

METHODS: The study was divided into two phases. The first phase examined baseline dextromethorphan metabolic phenotyping and baseline pharmacokinetics of propafenone enantiomers. The second phase was a repeat of the first phase except that it was conducted after subjects took 20 mg/day fluoxetine for 10 days. There was at least a 2-week washout period between the two phases.

RESULTS: All nine subjects had dextromethorphan MR values &lt;0.3 at baseline and were classified as having an extensive metabolizer phenotype for CYP2D6. The dextromethorphan MR for all subjects remained at less than 0.3 after pretreatment with fluoxetine (20 mg/day) for 10 days. However, there were significant differences of mean MR values before and after fluoxetine therapy (0.028 +/- 0.031 versus 0.080 +/- 0.058; P = .001), indicating a strong inhibition of the CYP2D6 activity by fluoxetine in Chinese subjects.

Metabolism of propafenone enantiomers was also impaired significantly after fluoxetine. For S-propafenone, AUC_(0-[infinity]) increased from 2238.3 +/- 725.2 ug x h x L-1 at baseline to 3371.2 +/- 986.7 ug x h x L-1 (P = .001). For R-propafenone, AUC_(0-[infinity]) also increased from 1576.3 +/- 573.1 ug x h x L-1 before fluoxetinetherapy to 2370.7 +/- 704.5 ug x h x L-1 (P = .005)."	0.4	0.02	9

SUBJECTS
Twelve healthy male and twelve healthy female subjects aged between 18 and 45 years participated in this three-period crossover study. They were extensively screened within 3 weeks of study entry and had to be medically and mentally healthy, as evidenced by medical history, full physical examination, routine clinical laboratory investigations and ECG. Their body mass index had to be within the range 19-29 kg/m2 and they were not allowed to be smokers. Subjects were screened for being extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 using dextromethorphan as a probe.

Of the 12 males and 12 female subjects enrolled into the study, three subjects (1 male, 2 females) discontinued the study due to the emergence of adverse events on days 21, 23, and 27, respectively, of the 27 day treatment period.

METHODS
Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. They were randomly assigned to one of six treatment sequences in this three-period crossover study without washout intervals. They were admitted to the clinical pharmacology institute two days before the start of the study. In order to mimic clinical practice as much as possible, paroxetine was administered in the morning and mirtazapine in the evening, with a 12h interval between administrations. From day 1 up to and including day 26 paroxetine 20 or 40 mg or placebo was administered at 9 a.m. and mirtazapine 15 or 30 mg or placebo at 9 p.m. each day.

The treatments used were: (A) 20 mg paroxetine plus one placebo paroxetine capsule at 9 a.m. and two placebo mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the first three days followed by two 20 mg paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and two placebo mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days; (B) two placebo paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and one 15 mg mirtazapine plus one placebo mirtazapine tablet at 9 p.m. for 3 days followed by two placebo paroxetine capsules at 9 a.m. and two 15 mg mirtazapine tablets at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days; (C) 20 mg paroxetine plus one placebo paroxetine capsule at 9 a.m. and 15 mg mirtazapine plus one placebo mirtazapine tablet at 9 p.m. for 3 days followed by two 20 mg paroxetine at 9 a.m. and two 15 mg mirtazapine at 9 p.m. for the following 6 days. Thus, six possible treatment sequences (TS1 - TS6) were used (Table 1). In those treatment sequences in which either paroxetine or mirtazapine had also been administered in the preceding treatment sequence, the drug was continued at the highest dose, i.e. two 20 mg capsules for paroxetine and two 15 mg tablets for mirtazapine. Two males and two females were randomized to each of the six treatment sequences.

RESULTS

Adding paroxetine to mirtazapine treatment increased the mirtazapine plasma concentrations. The AUC_0-24 increased by approximately 17% during concomitant administration of paxoetine. Statistically significant differences were observed in AUC_0-24 and C_max,av."	0.03	0.04	20

description:
NOTE: AUC_I/AUC in the DIKB knowledge-base is from the 6 participants classified as homozygous EMs and the value is for the R-enantiomer. The AUC increase for the S-enantiomer was greater; please see the full text. 

Eighteen healthy subjects, of whom six each were homozygous extensive metabolizers (homEMs), heterozygous extensive metabolizers (hetEMs), or poor metabolizers (PMs) for CYP2C19, participated in the study. Each subject received either placebo or fluvoxamine, 25 mg twice daily for 6 days, then a single oral dose of 60 mg of racemic lansoprazole. The plasma concentrations of lansoprazole enantiomers and lansoprazole sulphone were subsequently measured for 24 h post lansoprazole administration using liquid chromatography.

In the homEMs and hetEMs, fluvoxamine significantly increased the AUC(0, inf) and C max and prolonged the elimination half-life of both (R)- and (S)-lansoprazole, whereas in the PMs, the only statistically significant effect of fluvoxamine was on
the AUC(0, inf) for (R)-lansoprazole. The mean fluvoxamine-mediated percent increase in the AUC(0, inf) of (R)-lansoprazole in the homEMs compared with the PMs was significant ( P = 0.0117); however, C max did not differ among the three CYP2C19 genotypes. On the other hand, fluvoxamine induced a significant percent increase in both the AUC(0, inf) and C max for (S)-lansoprazole in the homEMs compared with the hetEMs ( P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0125, respectively) as well as compared with the PMs ( P &lt; 0.0001 for each parameter).

      Eighteen healthy Japanese volunteers (9 men and 9
women) who were H. pylori-negative were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 25.1 +/- 3.8 years and mean body weight was 56.6 +/- 13.3 kg. The mutated alleles for CYP2C19, CYP2C19*3(*3), and CYP2C19*2(*2) had been identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods of De Morais et al, before this study. The CYP2C19 genotype analyses revealed 5 different patterns as follows: *1/*1 in 6, *1/*2 in 3, *1/*3 in 3, *2/*2 in 5, and *2/*3 in 1. These were divided into 3 groups, homozygous EMs (*1/*1, n = 6), heterozygous EMs (*1/*2 and *1/*3, n = 6), and PMs (*2/*2 and *2/*3, n = 6).
      A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled
crossover study design in 3 phases was conducted at
intervals of 2 weeks. Fluvoxamine (25 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of a tablet (Luvox, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Osaka, Japan), or matched placebo was given orally twice a day (9 AM, 9 PM) for 6 days. On day 6, they took a single oral 60-mg
dose of lansoprazole (Takepron, Takeda Pharmaceutical
Co, Ltd, Osaka, Japan) with 25 mg dose of fluvoxamine, or placebo after overnight fasting (9 AM).
Fluvoxamine pretreatment significantly increased AUC_0-24 of lansoprazole by 3.8-fold in homozygous EMs (P&lt;0.01) and 2.5-fold in heterozygous EMs (P&lt;0.05), and prolonged elimination half-life by 3.0-fold in homozygous EMs (P&lt;0.01) and by 1.7-fold in heterozygous EMs (P&lt;0.05), respectively.

SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers aged 22 to 27 years (weight range, 67-95 kg; body mass index range, 21-26 kg/m2) participated in this study after having given written informed consent. The subjects were ascertained to be in good health by medical history, a full clinical examination, and standard hematologic and blood chemical laboratory tests before enrollment.
METHODS: This study was an open crossover study with 3 phases. Between phases 1 and 2, there was a 1-week-long washout period, and between phases 2 and 3, there was a washout period of 2 weeks. The first phase was a control period, in which all volunteers received a single oral dose of bupropion (Zyban sustained release, 150 mg; GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, United Kingdom). In the second and third phases the volunteers received a 4-day-long oral antiplatelet agent pretreatment in randomized balanced order with either clopidogrel (Plavix, 75 mg once daily; Sanofi Synthelabo, Guildford, United Kingdom) or ticlopidine
(Ticlid, 250 mg twice daily; Sanofi Synthelabo). On day 4, 1 hour after the last dose of the antiplatelet agent, a single 150-mg dose of bupropion was administered. Venous blood samples (10 mL each) for determination of bupropion and hydroxybupropion concentrations were taken just before and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after administration of bupropion. In all phases the volunteers fasted for 8 hours before
and 4 hours after administration of bupropion. Identical meals were provided on the 3 study days. Volunteers were also required to refrain from strenuous physical exercise, alcohol- or caffeine-containing drinks, smoking, grapefruit juice, and other medications for 2 days before and after study drug administration.
RESULTS: Both of the thienopyridine
derivatives had a significant effect on the AUC of
bupropion: in the clopidogrel phase, the bupropion
AUC increased by 60% (P = .02; 95% CI, 21% to
98%)."	0.15	0.075	12

he pharmacokinetic interactions of sertraline and fluoxetine with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine were studied in 18 healthy male volunteers phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan.

Desipramine Cmax was increased 4.0-fold versus 31% and AUC0-24 was increased 4.8-fold versus 23% for fluoxetine versus sertraline, respectively, relative to baseline after 3 weeks of coadministration. Desipramine trough concentrations approached baseline within 1 week of sertraline discontinuation but remained elevated for the 3-week follow-up period after fluoxetine discontinuation. Concentrations of SSRIs and their metabolites correlated significantly with desipramine concentration changes (for fluoxetine/norfluoxetine, r = 0.94 to 0.96; p &lt; 0.001; for sertraline/desmethylsertraline, r = 0.63; p &lt; 0.01).

description:
SUBJECTS: Sixty men aged 18-55 years were eligible to participate in the study if they had previously been genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers or ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 substrates, on the basis of genetic testing. They were also required to have a body mass index of 18-30 kg/m2, supine blood pressure of 100-140 mmHg systolic/50-90 mmHg diastolic, and to smoke no more than 10 cigarettes, two cigars or two pipes per day. The subjects were considered to be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), serum chemistry, and hematology and urinalysis performed during the screening phase.
Exclusion criteria included: poor or intermediate CYP2D6 metabolizers, known allergy to study medications, recent history of substance abuse, history of any systemic disease or positive serology (including hepatitis B and C), bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 50 bpm) or consumption of &gt; 450 mg of caffeine per day. No medications (including non-prescription) were permitted during the course of the study, with the exception of acetaminophen (up to 1500 mg/day) for headache, anticholinergic agents for the treatment of emergent EPS and lorazepam for the management of muscle spasm at the investigator’s discretion.
Both treatment groups were balanced for demographic characteristics (Table 1). All subjects were male and aged 18-54 years, with the majority being white (75%). Ten subjects (all of whom were randomized to receive the combination of paroxetine and paliperidone ER followed by paliperidone ER alone) discontinued study medication and all in the first period (in which they received the combination regimen).

METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-treatment, two-period, crossover study (Fig. 1). The study consisted of three phases: screening, beginning within 21 days before first study drug administration; an open-label treatment phase consisting of two treatment periods; and end-of-study evaluations at study completion or upon withdrawal. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment-sequence groups (30 subjects per sequence group) according to a computer-generated randomization scheme. During the open-label treatment phase, all subjects received each of the following in order determined by randomization: one tablet of paliperidone ER 3 mg on Day 1 (Treatment A); or paroxetine 20 mg/day on Days 1-13, and one tablet of paliperidone ER 3 mg on Day 10 (Treatment B). Paliperidone ER was administered in the morning (between 07:30-10:00) while subjects were in the fasting state (overnight, for at least 10 h), and subjects continued to fast for 4 h after paliperidone ER administration prior to a standardized meal. On the day that both paroxetine and paliperidone ER were taken, paroxetine was administered in the fasted state 30 min before paliperidone ER; at all other time points, paroxetine was taken with food in the morning. There was a washout period of 14-28 days between paliperidone ER treatments.

RESULTS: The 90% CI for the ratio of geometric treatment means was within the conventional no-effect boundaries (80-125%) for C_max, but not for AUC_0-last or AUC_inf (Table 3). However, the higher total exposure to paliperidone following administration of paliperidone ER and paroxetine compared with paliperidone ER alone was not considered clinically relevant, with a ratio of geometric treatment means of 116.48% for AUC_inf (90% CI: 104.49-129.84)."	0.003	0.02	50

description:
SUBJECTS: Thirteen men entered the study (eight were white, four black, and one mixed ethnicity). The mean (range) age, weight, and height of the patients were 37.5 (21–59) years, 86.7 (49–140) kg, and 177.8 (160–193) cm, respectively. Nine men (69.2%) had schizoaffective disorder, three (23.1%) had bipolar disorder, and one (7.7%) had paranoid schizophrenia. Six patients were withdrawn because of lack of efficacy (N = 2), adverse events (N = 2), and refusal to continue (N = 2). All 13 patients were included in the safety analysis, but only the seven patients who completed the entire study were entered into the pharmacokinetic analysis.

METHODS:   Thirteen men (aged 18–60 years) with selected psychotic disorders were entered into this open-label, non-randomized, escalating-dose, pharmacokinetic trial conducted at a single center.  Psychotropic medications were withdrawn on day, 1 and patients underwent a 2-day washout period. On days 3 to 8, patients received quetiapine in escalating doses from 25 to 150 mg three times daily, at approximately 7 a.m., 3 p.m., and 11 p.m. Quetiapine 150 mg three times daily was then administered on days 9 to 18. The final dose was given on the morning of day 19. Cimetidine 400 mg was initiated on the afternoon of day 15 and was administered three times daily with each dose of quetiapine thereafter.

RESULTS: The mean plasma concentration versus time profiles for quetiapine determined on days 11, 15, and 19 were similar with a slight increase in the mean plasma concentration during coadministration with cimetidine. Using day 15 as baseline, geometric mean steady-state AUC_0–8h and C_max increased by 24% and 19%, respectively, after coadministration with cimetidine (day 19). Using day 11 as baseline, however, increases of only 10% and 4% were detected. In addition, differences between the 2 baseline days (11 and 15) in mean steady-state AUC_0–8h and C_max were 13% and 14%, respectively (intrasubject variability).

The geometric mean quetiapine AUC_0–8h,ss was significantly higher with cimetidine than without compared with day 15 (p=0.002) but not on day 11 (p=0.09). However, variability between the days without cimetidine coadministration (i.e., days 11 and 15) was also significant (p=0.04), with a change of 13% (p=0.04)."	0.45	1.2	7

SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy male volunteers aged 18-45 years participated in this study. They were extensively screened within 3 weeks of study entry and had to be medically and mentally healthy, as evidenced by medical history, full physical examination, routine clinical laboratory investigations and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Their body-mass index had to be within the range 19 +/- 29 kg/m2, and they were not allowed to be heavy smokers (less than ten cigarettes or equivalent per day). On admission to the unit, they were screened for alcohol or drug use. No concomitant medication was allowed, with the exception of paracetamol for severe (head)aches.

METHODS: Twelve male subjects meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of two groups in this two-period crossover study, with a medication-free washout interval of at least 2 weeks. For each study period, they were admitted to the clinical pharmacology institute 1 day before the start of the study. After admission, subjects were re-screened for alcohol and drugs. During one treatment period, subjects were given cimetidine (800 mg b.i.d. orally) for 14 days, with mirtazapine (30 mg nocte orally) added from the 6th to the 12th day of this period. During the alternate treatment period, cimetidine tablets were replaced by placebo tablets. Medication was taken together with water. Standard meals and snacks were served at fixed times of day. The use of alcohol was forbidden for 48 h prior to the start of the study and up to 48 h after the last study day. There were restrictions with regard to the use of coffee, tea and chocolate. The daily dosages of mirtazapine (30 mg nocte) and cimetidine (800 mg b.i.d.) were in agreement with the manufacturers' recommendations and coincided with current therapeutic practice.

RESULTS: The combined administration of mirtazapine and cimetidine resulted in a statistically significant increase in AUC_0-24 of mirtazapine compared with the administration of mirtazapine as a single drug (AUC_0-24: 979 versus 635 ng x h/ml)."	0.03	1.6	12

route of administration: oral (both duloxetine and fluvoxamine), and IV (duloxetine)

study duration: 24 days

population: 14 healthy smokers (all male)

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms? No

ages: 18-65

description: Healthy subjects were selected by the investigators based on their medical history, physical examination, ECGs and routine clinical laboratory test results. Up to 18 male smokers (aged 18–65 years) were to be enrolled in the fluvoxamine study. Sixteen men who were smokers were enrolled, and 14 completed the study. Two subjects were withdrawn by the investigator before receiving the study drug. The mean (+/- SD) age of the subjects was 37 +/- 11 years, the mean height was 174 +/- 6 cm, the mean bodyweight was 76.9 +/- 10.6 kg and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 25.4 +/- 2.9 kg/m2. The majority of subjects were Caucasian (81%) and the rest were African American.

METHODS: This was an open-label, four-period, sequential crossover study. The dosing sequence started with duloxetine administration only (intravenous or oral; dosing periods 1 and 2), followed by duloxetine (intravenous or oral) in the presence of steady-state fluvoxamine (dosing periods 3 and 4). Duloxetine administration was planned on days 1, 5, 14 and 20 and fluvoxamine was administered from days 8 to 24. The sequence of intravenous and oral duloxetine dosing was randomized. The oral dose of duloxetine was a single 60-mg dose and the intravenous dose of duloxetine was a 10-mg infusion over 30 minutes. Fluvoxamine was initiated at a single dose of 50 mg for 1 day followed by 100 mg once daily for at least 16 additional days. Subjects unable to tolerate fluvoxamine 100 mg once daily were discontinued from the study. The washout period between each dose of duloxetine was a minimum of 4 days and a maximum of 14 days.

RESULTS: The oral duloxetine C_max and AUC_inf were increased by 141% (90% CI 93, 200) and 460% (90% CI 359, 584), respectively, whereas the intravenous duloxetine AUC_inf increased by 170% (90% CI 121, 230)."	0.06	0.1	14

route of administration: oral

study duration: 4 days

population: 12 healthy volunteers (all male), all nonsmokers

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms? Yes -- CYP2D6 genotypes - 8 EMs, 1 PM, 3 UMs 

ages: 20-29

description: 12 male volunteers (age range: 20–29 years; weight range: 65–89 kg) were recruited. The subjects were ascertained to be in good health by medical history, physical examination, and standard hematological and clinical chemistry tests. All subjects were non-smokers and used no concomitant medications.

All 12 subjects completed the study according to the protocol. Genotyping of CYP2D6 revealed that eight subjects could be classified as EMs: six of them were homozygous for CYP2D6*1 allele, and two of them had the genotype CYP2D6*1/*4. One subject was classified as PM having the CYP2D6*3/*4 genotype, and three subjects without *3 or *4 were classified as UMs having a CYP2D6*1/*1x2 genotype. This high frequency of UM (25%) was much more than expected, but the subjects were not selected for the study by genotype.

METHODS: The study was an open-label, randomized, three-phase crossover study with a washout period of 4 weeks between the phases. The volunteers were given either no pretreatment (control phase) or oral terbinafine (terbinafine phase) for 4 days in a randomized order. The dose of terbinafine (Lamisil 250mg tablet; Novartis Pharma, Huningue, France) was 250mg once a day at 0800 hours for 4 days. Terbinafine were self-administered by subjects except for the last doses, which were administered by the study personnel.

One hour after the last dose of terbinafine was ingested, all volunteers received 75 mg oral dose of venlafaxine (Efexor 75 mg tablet; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, New Lane, Havant, Hants, England) at 0900 hours with 150 ml of water. During all phases, the subjects fasted overnight before administration of venlafaxine and continued fasting until a standardized lunch was served 4 h after venlafaxine ingestion. The subjects were forbidden to use any other medication for 14 days before and during the study and any drug known to cause enzyme induction or inhibition for a period of 30 days before the study. Caffeine, grapefruit juice, and alcohol-containing beverages were not allowed during the study.

RESULTS: When all the subjects were examined together, without subdivision into groups according to the genotype, terbinafine pretreatment increased the area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC_0–inf) of venlafaxine 4.9-fold (range: 1.5- to 8.2-fold; P&lt;0.001).

description:
SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy Japanese volunteers (nine males, three females) were enrolled in this study. Their mean +/- SD of age (range) was 24.8 +/- 2.5 (20–35) years and mean body weight was 58.3 +/- 8.5 (46–75) kg. The subjects had the following CYP2D6 genotypes: wt/wt (4 subjects), *10/wt (6), *10/*10 (1) and *5/*10 (1), respectively. No subjects regarded as poor metabolizers were included. These patients were divided into three groups according to the number of mutated alleles: no mutated allele in 4, one mutated allele in 6 and two mutated alleles in 2 subjects.

METHODS: A randomized crossover study design was conducted at intervals of 4 weeks. One capsule containing either 125 mg of terbinafine or a matched placebo with 240 ml of tap water was given once daily at 0800 hours for 6 days. Compliance of the test drug was confirmed by pill-count.

RESULTS: The AUC (0–48) of paroxetine during trebinafine treatment was higher than placebo by 2.53-fold (1.85, 4.58-fold). The total AUC of paroxetine during trebinafine treatment was higher than placebo by 2.88-fold (1.99, 5.41-fold).

Description:
The pharmacokinetic interactions of sertraline and fluoxetine with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine were studied in 18 healthy male volunteers phenotyped as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan. Concentrations in plasma were determined after 7 days of desipramine (50 mg/day) dosing alone, during the 21 days of desipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) coadministration (fluoxetine, 20 mg/day; sertraline, 50 mg/day), and for 21 days of continued desipramine administration after SSRI discontinuation. Desipramine Cmax was increased 4.0-fold versus 31% and AUC0-24 was increased 4.8-fold versus 23% for fluoxetine versus sertraline, respectively, relative to baseline after 3 weeks of coadministration. Desipramine trough concentrations approached baseline within 1 week of sertraline discontinuation but remained elevated for the 3-week follow-up period after fluoxetine discontinuation. Concentrations of SSRIs and their metabolites correlated significantly with desipramine concentration changes (for fluoxetine/norfluoxetine, r = 0.94 to 0.96; p &lt; 0.001; for sertraline/desmethylsertraline, r = 0.63; p &lt; 0.01).

Description:
The pharmacokinetics of desipramine when coadministered with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine and sertraline were studied in 24 healthy male volunteers (CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers). Desipramine (50 mg/day) was administered for 23 days in each phase of the crossover study with a 7-day drug-free period between phases. In addition, subjects were randomly assigned to receive concomitant paroxetine (20 mg/day on days 8 through 17 followed by 30 mg/day on days 18 through 20) or sertraline (50 mg/day on days 8 through 17 and 100 mg/day on days 18 through 20). SSRI treatments were switched between phases. After 10 days of coadministration at the lower dose, mean desipramine maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax) relative to baseline increased from 37.8 to 173 ng/mL (+358%) with paroxetine versus from 36.1 to 51.9 ng/mL (+44%) with sertraline; the mean desipramine 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC[24]) increased from 634 to 3,305 ng x h/mL (+421%) with paroxetine versus from 611 to 838 ng x h/mL (+37%) with sertraline; and the mean desipramine trough value (C0) increased from 18.5 to 113 ng/mL (+511%) with paroxetine versus from 18.3 to 21.8 ng/mL (+19%) with sertraline (all increases, p &lt; 0.001). An approximately 10-fold increase in the Cmax and AUC(24) of paroxetine and an approximately 2-fold increase in these parameters for sertraline occurred simultaneously with the desipramine concentration changes. Thus, when coadministered with 50 mg/day desipramine, sertraline had significantly less pharmacokinetic interaction than paroxetine with desipramine at the recommended starting dosages of 50 mg/day and 20 mg/day, respectively."	0.05	0.05	17

ages: mean(std dev):42 (9)

AUC_i/AUC (24 hour): 796/516 = 1.54

Description: 
Participants received a 50 mg single dose of either desipramine or imipramine under three conditions: alone, after a single 150 mg dose of sertraline, and after the eighth daily 150 mg dose of sertraline. Plasma samples were analyzed for desipramine or imipramine concentration by HPLC with electrochemical detection, and pharmacokinetics were determined with use of noncompartmental analysis of individual data. RESULTS: Multiple-dose, but not single-dose, treatment with sertraline significantly reduced apparent plasma clearance (CL/F) and prolonged the half-life of desipramine relative to baseline. These changes resulted in higher plasma desipramine concentrations, as indicated by a significant increase in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity [AUC(0-infinity)] (22% and 54%, respectively). Both single- and multiple-dose treatment with sertraline significantly reduced the CL/F of imipramine. This effect was stronger after multiple predoses of sertraline, when imipramine Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) were increased by 39% and 68%, respectively. These treatment effects were consistent between individuals."	0.05	0.15	6

description:
SUBJECTS: Six healthy male Japanese volunteers who had given informed consent participated in this study. Their mean age and body weight were 31 +/- 4 years (range, 26-36 years) and 66.3 +/- 5.1 kg (range, 57-72 kg), respectively. Three subjects were nonsmokers and three were smokers (20-40 cigarettes per day). All subjects were in good health as assessed by medical history, physical examination, routine hematology, blood chemistry, urinary tests, and cardiac function (electrocardiography).

STUDY DESIGN: A randomized crossover design with two phases was used. A 7-day washout period separated the two treatment conditions. Each subject received an oral dose of mexiletine (200 mg) at 7:00 AM with 100 mL of water. In the one phase, they received mexiletine alone (study 1); in the other phase, they received fluvoxamine (50 mg twice a day) for 7 days, and on the eighth day they received mexiletine and fluvoxamine concomitantly at 7:00 AM (study 2). Each subject fasted overnight for at least 10 hours before the administration of mexiletine at 7:00 AM and continued to fast for an additional 6 hours after administration. The subjects were instructed not to take any medications or drink anything that included caffeine or alcoholic beverages for 1 week before the study and throughout the study.

RESULTS: The area under the concentration-time curve and serum peak concentration of mexiletine in study 2 were significantly increased compared with those in study 1 (10.4 +/- 4.85 versus 6.70 +/- 3.21 µg x h/mL, P = .006 and 0.623 +/- 0.133 versus 0.536 +/- 0.164 µg/mL, P = .008, respectively).

SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy white subjects, 6 men and 6 women, aged 22 to 45 years (mean, 30 years) and weighing 56 to 94 kg (mean, 81 kg for the men and 69 kg for the women), participated in this study, which included 7 EMs and 5 PMs of debrisoquin. The debrisoquin metabolic ratio (MR) ranged from 0.57 to 2.2 in EMs and from 35 to 260 in PMs. Genotyping of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 was performed in 1 subject (subject No. 12) by the methods of Heim and Meyer (CYP2D6*3 and *4) and de Morais et al (CYP2C19*2). All subjects were healthy as assessed by medical history, physical examination, urine drug screen, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram, virologic testing, and routine laboratory analyses. All were nonsmokers and had been drug-free for at least 1 week before the study.
Two EM subjects (subjects No. 1 and No. 4) were not able to participate in period 3 because of travel abroad and, therefore, were replaced by 2 new EMs (subjects No. 12 and No. 13). They also followed the protocol in period 1 before entering period 3.

METHODS: Single oral doses of 100 mg caffeine and 20 mg omeprazole were given separately to 5 EMs and 5 PMs of debrisoquin to assess the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, respectively. Initially, a single oral dose of fluvoxamine (25 mg to PMs and 50 mg to EMs) was given [Period 1], followed by 1 week of daily administration of 25 mg × 2 to EMs and 25 mg × 1 to PMs [Period 2]. Caffeine (day 6) and omeprazole (day 7) were again administered at the steady state of fluvoxamine. Later the study protocol was repeated with a lower dose of fluvoxamine, 10 mg × 2 to EMs and 10 mg × 1 to PMs for 1 week [Period 3]. Concentrations of fluvoxamine, caffeine, omeprazole, and their metabolites were analyzed by HPLC methods in plasma and urine.
Because fluvoxamine kinetics is partly dependent on the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6, we gave double the dose of fluvoxamine to EMs of debrisoquin compared with PMs of debrisoquin to obtain similar plasma concentrations of fluvoxamine.

RESULTS: The geometric means of omeprazole AUC(0-8 h) increased with 174% (P &lt; .001) with 10 mg x 1 or x 2 [Period 3] and 330% (P &lt; .001) with 25 mg x 1 or × 2 of fluvoxamine [Periods 1-2]."	0.02	0.02	10

In the second study, midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) was given intravenously to six of the same subjects, after similar pretreatments. Plasma samples were collected, and psychomotor performance was measured. Erythromycin increased the area under the midazolam concentration-time curve after oral intake more than four times (p &lt; 0.001) and reduced clearance of intravenously administered midazolam by 54% (p &lt; 0.05). In psychomotor tests (e.g., saccadic eye movements), the interaction between erythromycin and orally administered midazolam was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) from 15 minutes to 6 hours. Metabolism of both erythromycin and midazolam by the same cytochrome P450IIIA isozyme may explain the observed pharmacokinetic interaction. Prescription of midazolam for patients receiving erythromycin should be avoided or the dose of midazolam should be reduced by 50% to 75%.&quot;"	0.015	0.5	12

The effect of erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, was investigated in 12 healthy volunteers. Each subject received a single 10 mg dose of atorvastatin on two separate occasions, separated by 2 weeks. Erythromycin (500 mg qid) was given from 7 days before through 4 days after the second atorvastatin dose. Atorvastatin concentrations were determined by an enzyme inhibition assay, which measured both atorvastatin and active metabolites. When erythromycin was coadministered with atorvastatin, mean Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) increased by 37.7% and 32.5%, respectively. Mean terminal half-life was similar following each atorvastatin dose. Possible mechanisms for this interaction include erythromycin inhibition of first-pass conversion of atorvastatin to inactive metabolites and erythromycin inhibition of P-glycoprotein-mediated intestinal or biliary secretion.&quot;"	0.01	0.5	11

description:
Eighteen healthy Japanese volunteers (9 men and 9 women) who were H. pylori-negative were enrolled in this study. Their mean age was 25.1 +/- 3.8 years and mean body weight was 56.6 +/- 13.3 kg. Most subjects in this study had participated in our previous studies. The mutated alleles for CYP2C19, CYP2C19*3(*3), and CYP2C19*2(*2) had been identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods of De Morais et al, before this study. The CYP2C19 genotype analyses revealed 5 different patterns as follows: *1/*1 in 6, *1/*2 in 3, *1/*3 in 3, *2/*2 in 5, and *2/*3 in 1. These were divided into 3 groups, homozygous EMs (*1/*1, n=6), heterozygous EMs (*1/*2 and *1/*3, n=6), and PMs (*2/*2 and *2/*3, n=6).
METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study design in 3 phases was conducted at intervals of 2 weeks. Clarithromycin (400 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of 2 tablets, fluvoxamine (25 mg) as a capsule containing the equivalent of a tablet, or matched placebo was given orally twice a day (9 AM, 9 PM) for 6 days. Six volunteers within each group were allocated to each of the 3 different drug sequences: placebo-clarithromycin-fluvoxamine, fluvoxamine-placebo-clarithromycin, or clarithromycin-fluvoxamine-placebo. On day 6, they took a single oral 60-mg dose of lansoprazole with 400 mg dose of clarithromycin, 25mg dose of fluvoxamine, or placebo after overnight fasting (9 AM). No other medications were taken during the study periods. No meal was allowed until 4 hours after the dosing (1 PM). The use of alcohol, tea, coffee, and cola was forbidden during the test days.
RESULTS: Clarithromycin treatment significantly increased Cmax and AUC_0-24 of lansoprazole in heterozygous EMs (P&lt;0.05) and in PMs (P&lt;0.01), and prolonged elimination half-life by 1.6-fold (P&lt;0.05) in PMs. Calculated from Table 1, the AUC_i/AUC were: 1.62 (homozygous EMs), 1.71 (heterozygous EMs [p&lt;0.05]), and 1.89 (PMs [p&lt;0.01])."	0.06	0.8	18

ages: mean age 38.0 +/- 12.4

description:
SUBJECTS:Nine non-smoking stable schizophrenic patients (mean age 38.0 +/- 12.4 years and weight 59.1 +/- 12.3 kg) gave informed consent to participated in this study. Each patient met the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, had not previously received CLZ or FLV and had not consumed beverages containing caffeine, alcohol or grapefruit juice for at least 1 month prior to the study. Patients were also not taking any known CYP1A2 inducers or inhibitors or other routinely prescribed medications. Only lorazepam “as needed” 2 mg every 4–6 h was allowed during the study. All patients were evaluated to be physically healthy by physical examination, medical history, and routine hematological, biochemical and urinalysis tests. These patients were not classified as refractory schizophrenics by the criteria proposed by Kane et al. (1988). Prior to the study, these patients were phenotyped with dextromethorphan and all subjects were extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6 (Lane et al. 1996). Also, prior to the study, these patients were also administered a test dose of caffeine 200 mg and CYP1A2 status was evaluated. Caffeine and metabolite ratios were within values previously reported by other investigators, indicating the absence of any unusual metabolizers of CYP1A2 in this group of patients (Bertilsson et al. 1994).

METHODS: On the first study day at 8:00 a.m., each patient received a single CLZ 50 mg dose (two 25 mg tablets). Venous blood samples (5 ml) were collected in heparinized tubes and obtained prior to the dosage administration and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h post-drug. The blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and the separated plasma frozen at 920°C until assay. FLV 50 mg was administered twice a day to each patient from day 3 to day 16. On day 15, CLZ 50 mg was given as a single dose. Blood samples were obtained at the same times during the first study period.

RESULTS: The total AUC of CLZ increased by a factor of 2.84 upon FLV addition (t = 5.364, P = 0.0007).

description: Ten healthy, nonsmoking volunteers (6 male and 4 female), aged 21–47 years, initiated participation after giving written informed consent. All were active, ambulatory adults, with no evidence of medical disease and taking no other medication. The ethnic distribution was: 7 Caucasian, 2 African-American, 1 Hispanic.

METHODS: The study was a randomized, double blind, 5-way crossover study with at least 7 days elapsing between trials. Medications were: trazodone hydrochloride, 50 mg (Desyrel; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ); zolpidem tartrate, 5 mg (Ambien; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ); and clarithromycin, 500 mg (Biaxin; Abbott, North Chicago, IL). The five treatment conditions were: (i) placebo + placebo, (ii) zolpidem + placebo, (iii) zolpidem + clarithromycin, (iv) trazodone + placebo, and (v) trazodone + clarithromycin. All medications were identically packaged in opaque capsules (void space filled with sucrose) and administered orally. Subjects were given 500 mg doses of clarithromycin (or matching placebo) at approximately 24 h, 8 h, and 1 h prior to, and again at 8 h after, administration of zolpidem, trazodone, or placebo.

At 7 am on the study day, subjects were admitted to the Clinical Psychopharmacology Research Unit at Tufts University School of Medicine. They ingested a light breakfast with no caffeine containing beverages or food, and no grapefruit juice. The 500 mg dose of clarithromycin (or matching placebo) was administered with 200 ml of tap water. One hour later, subjects took a “challenge” dose of 5 mg zolpidem, 50 mg of trazodone, or placebo with 200 ml tap water. Volunteers resumed a normal diet at noon (without caffeine).

Venous blood samples were drawn into heparinized tubes prior to challenge dosing and at postdosage times of 1/2, 1, 1 1/2, 2, 2 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 h. Another 500 mg of clarithromycin or placebo was given following the 8-h blood sample. The subjects were then discharged from the study unit. They returned the next morning for a 24-h blood sample. All blood samples were centrifuged, and the plasma was separated and frozen until the time of the assay.

RESULTS: Coadministration of trazodone with clarithromycin compared to placebo significantly increased peak plasma concentration (C_max) (681 ng/ml vs. 922 ng/ml), prolonged t_1/2 (7.1 h vs. 13.9 h), increased AUC (4,668 ng/ml x h vs. 9,275 ng/ml x h), and reduced oral clearance (166 ml/min vs. 89 ml/min)."	0.05	0.5	10

SUBJECTS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers were enrolled and 18 (9 men and 9 women) completed the study. The subjects ranged in age from 18 to 41 years (mean 26 years). Weight ranged from 43 to 71 kg (mean 56 kg) for the women and 60 to 83 kg (mean 71 kg) for the
men (Table I). Health status was established on the
basis of medical history, physical examination, and
biochemical laboratory test findings. Subjects         were excluded from entry into the study if these test results were outside the normal ranges and if there was
a history of drug or alcohol abuse. Additional exclusion criteria included: sensitivity to antidepressants or cimetidine; ingestion within the prior 3 months of agents that might alter hepatic enzyme activity; ingestion of any prescription or investigational drug within one month and any nonprescription drug within 2 weeks before the study; excessive tobacco smoking (more than 10 cigarettes/day) or caffeine ingestion (more than 5 cups of coffee/day).
 Of the original 24 volunteers, six did not complete the study. One withdrew from the study for personal reasons unrelated to the drug, and one other participant was dropped from the study because of an infection noticed on day 5, also unrelated to the study drug. Four volunteers withdrew because of apparent drug-related events on days 1 to 3. The symptoms leading to discontinuation included one or more of the following: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, mydriasis, nervousness, tremor, abdominal pain, and headache. The remaining 18 volunteers completed the study.

METHODS: The study was conducted according to an open-label, nonrandomized, cross-over design and lasted 11 days.
The study was divided into two 5-day periods during which the participants resided in a clinical unit, with the exception of a single night in between the two 5-day periods that was spent outside the clinic. The subjects began their stay on the night before the first experimental day. At 8:00 AM of the following morning (day 1), each participant ate a standard, medium fat breakfast consisting of cereal, low-fat milk, one egg, one piece of bacon, one piece of toast with butter, and one glass of orange juice. Thirty minutes later, the participants ingested a single 25-mg tablet of venlafaxine. A multiple oral dose regimen began after this first dose; each participant ingested a single 50-mg tablet of venlafaxine with 8 ounces of water every 8 hours for the next 10 days.
The control period (i.e., no cimetidine) lasted from day 1 through day 5. Subjects fasted overnight before the morning dose on days 5 and 10. The experimental drug interaction phase of the study began on the evening of day 6, when each subject ingested a single 800-mg tablet of cimetidine at 10:00 PM with 8 ounces of water. Venlafaxine dose administration continued during this phase of the study as described above. Once daily cimetidine administration (800 mg/day) continued through day 10, and participants were discharged from the clinical unit on day 11.

RESULTS: Consistent with the above findings, cimetidine produced a significant increase in the C_max, C_min, and AUC of venlafaxine (P &lt; 0.001) but no significant changes in these three parameters for 0-des-methylvenlafaxine."	0.15	0.8	18

Studies 1 and 2 enrolled healthy male and female subjects aged 18-45 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 18-33 kg/m2 between August and September 2006 (Study 1) or August and November 2006 (Study 2). Excluded were women who were pregnant, breastfeeding or of childbearing potential without an acceptable contraceptive method; subjects with any significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric illness or history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome or acute dystonic reactions and subjects with a history of allergy to the study treatments or related compounds, or exposure to monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers in the 4 weeks before the study.

The majority of subjects in Study 2 were male (96%), and 64% were white. The mean +/- SD age was 29 +/- 8 years (range 19-44 years), the mean +/- SD weight was 79.5 +/- 8.7 kg (range 60.2-98.6 kg) and the mean +/- SD BMI was 25.3 +/- 2.6 kg/m2 (range 21.6-32.0 kg/m2). Of the subjects who received concomitant medications while taking aripiprazole and venlafaxine, eight received lorazepam for akathisia and five received benztropine for EPS-related AEs.

Of the 25 subjects who received treatment (safety sample), 23 completed treatment with escitalopram monotherapy and received adjunctive aripiprazole. Two subjects discontinued escitalopram monotherapy (investigator’s decision, n = 1; consent withdrawn, n = 1). Six subjects discontinued during adjunctive aripiprazole treatment (AEs, n = 3; consent withdrawn, n = 3) and 17 subjects completed the study (pharmacokinetic sample).

The design of Study 2 was similar, except that subjects received escitalopram 10 mg/day for 7 days (Day -7 to Day -1) before the addition of once-daily aripiprazole 10 mg/day on Study Day 1 for a further 14 days (Day +1 to Day +14).

Mean steady-state plasma concentration–time profiles for escitalopram administered alone or in combination with aripiprazole were similar (Figure 1C) with a small effect of aripiprazole 10 mg/day on AUC_TAU (7% increase; Table 2). Based on the escitalopram C_min on Day 14 (at t = 0 h and t = 24 h), escitalopram plasma concentration appeared to be at steady state (Table 2)."	0.01	0.01	17

description:
SUBJECTS: This was an open study of six young healthy male volunteers, all phenotyped as extensive metabolisers of sparteine (CYP2D6) (metabolic ratio &lt; 20) and mephenytoin (CYP2C19) (S/R ratio &lt; 0.5). All volunteers gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the regional ethics committee and the Danish National Board of Health. Before inclusion, all volunteers were screened by physical examination, laboratory tests and electrocardiogram.

METHODS: On study day 1, the volunteers took a single oral dose of 250 mg tolbutamide (CYP2C9) (Tolbutamid ''Dak'', Nycomed DAK, Denmark) at 0800 hours. On study day 2, the volunteers took 100 mg sparteine (CYP2D6) (Depasan, Giulini Pharma, Germany), 100 mg mephenytoin (CYP2C19) (Mesantoin, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, USA) and 200 mg caffeine (CYP1A2) (Koffein ''Dak'', Nycomed DAK) orally at 0800 hours.
On study day 3, following an overnight fast from 2400 hours, the volunteers took a single oral dose of 200 mg quinidine sulfate (Kinidin ''Dak'', Nycomed DAK), equivalent to 511 umol quinidine. The volunteers were allowed normal meals after the blood sample at t = 1 h was drawn. Following a washout period of 6-8 weeks, the volunteers took 100 mg of fluvoxamine (Fevarin, Solvay Duphar, Netherlands) daily at 0800 hours on study days -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4. The study procedures on days 1-4, above, were repeated. During the study, the volunteers refrained from intake of any other medications, alcohol or grapefruit juice. Consumption of coffee or xanthine-containing foods was not allowed for a period of 48 h before and the 12 h during caffeine testing. The quinidine and the quinidine and fluvoxamine sessions were performed without randomisation of the sequence, justified by only using hard end-points, i.e. drug- and metabolite-concentrations in plasma and urine, in the study.

RESULTS: The total apparent oral clearance of quinidine was calculated as: CLq = Dose / AUCq (0 -&gt; inf). The quinidine total apparent oral clearance, clearance by N-oxidation and by 3-hydroxylation were statistically significantly reduced during fluvoxamine treatment by medians of 29%, 33% and 44%, respectively.

Quote:

Twelve healthy male volunteers were randomly allocated to one of the two different treatment sequences, placebo-erythromycin or erythromycin-placebo, with an at least 6-week washout period between the two trial phases. Each volunteer received 400 mg erythromycin or matched placebo given orally three times a day for 10 days and an oral dose (0.8 mg) of alprazolam on the posttreatment day 8. Plasma concentration of alprazolam was measured up to 48 hours after the administration, and psychomotor function was assessed at each time of blood samplings with use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, visual analog scale, and Udvalg for kliniske undersï¿½er side effect rating scale. RESULTS: Erythromycin significantly (p < 0.001) increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curves (200 +/- 43 versus 322 +/- 49 ng . hr/ml from 0 to 48 hours and 229 +/- 52 versus 566 +/- 161 ng . hr/ml from 0 hour to infinity), decreased the apparent oral clearance (1.02 +/- 0.31 versus 0.41 +/- 0.12 ml/min/kg), and prolonged the elimination half-life (16.0 +/- 4.5 versus 40.3 +/- 14.4 hours) of alprazolam.

SUBJECTS: Subjects were nonsmokers who were of normal build and had no clinically significant abnormalities. Fifteen subjects (4 females and 11 males) completed the study. Thirteen subjects were Caucasian, 3 were Hispanic, and one was Asian. Ages ranged from 23 to 40 years (mean = 32 +/- 5 years). At admission, mean height was 173 +/- 10 cm and mean weight was 71 +/- 13 kg.

METHODS: The pharmacokinetics of 3 identical single therapeutic doses of olanzapine (5 mg) were determined in 15 healthy nonsmoking volunteers. The first dose of olanzapine was taken alone, the second given after a single oral dose of fluoxetine (60 mg), and the third given after 8 days of treatment with fluoxetine 60 mg, qd. There was an interval of 10 days between olanzapine doses of periods 1 and 2, and at least 15 days between olanzapine doses of periods 2 and 3. During each period, the volunteers remained in the clinical pharmacology unit for 24 hours following the administration of olanzapine.

RESULTS: After single coadministration of fluoxetine, the C_max and AUC_0-inf of olanzapine increased by 18%, whereas the total apparent clearance decreased by 15%.

description:
SUBJECTS: The study was carried out as an open, randomized, crossover study of 12 volunteers, all men with a median age of 23 years (range, 22-30 years). All were nonsmokers and had no known heart, liver, or kidney diseases according to clinical investigation, clinical chemical/hematological screening, and ECG test. They were not consuming alcohol or drugs on a regular basis at the time of the study. The volunteers consented to participate in the study on the basis of written and verbal information, and the study was approved by the regional ethics committee of the counties of Vejle and Funen and by the Danish National Board of Health.

METHODS: The volunteers were randomized into three groups. All three groups went through three testing periods, which were separated by 2 weeks of washout. In all three periods, the volunteers abstained from ingesting methylxanthine-containing beverages, foods, and medication for 3 days before study and until the last blood sample was drawn. In period A, a blood sample was drawn before intake of a tablet of 300 mg theophylline ethylenediamine (Teofylamin; Nycomed DAK, Copenhagen, Denmark), containing 257 mg theophylline. In period B, the volunteers received a tablet of 50 mg fluvoxamine (Solvay Duphar BV, Weesp, the Netherlands) for 1 day, and during the following 6 days they received 100 mg fluvoxamine each day. On day 4, a blood sample was drawn before the intake of 300 mg theophylline ethylenediamine; thereafter, blood samples were drawn at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 32, 48, 72, and 96 h.

RESULTS: The total theophylline clearance was calculated as EQUATION 1 [Cl_13DMX = Dose / AUC_13DMX(total)] where Cl is clearance and AUC_13DMX(total) is the area under the plasma concentration time curve calculated by the trapezoidal rule with extrapolation from the last measurable concentration to infinity. Complete absorption of theophylline from the intestine was assumed.

In addition, subjects were randomly assigned to receive concomitant paroxetine (20 mg/day on days 8 through 17 followed by 30 mg/day on days 18 through 20) or sertraline (50 mg/day on days 8 through 17 and 100 mg/day on days 18 through 20). SSRI treatments were switched between phases. After 10 days of coadministration at the lower dose, mean desipramine maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax) relative to baseline increased from 37.8 to 173 ng/mL (+358%) with paroxetine versus from 36.1 to 51.9 ng/mL (+44%) with sertraline; the mean desipramine 24-hour area under the concentration-time curve (AUC[24]) increased from 634 to 3,305 ng x h/mL (+421%) with paroxetine versus from 611 to 838 ng x h/mL (+37%) with sertraline; and the mean desipramine trough value (C0) increased from 18.5 to 113 ng/mL (+511%) with paroxetine versus from 18.3 to 21.8 ng/mL (+19%) with sertraline (all increases, p &lt; 0.001). An approximately 10-fold increase in the Cmax and AUC(24) of paroxetine and an approximately 2-fold increase in these parameters for sertraline occurred simultaneously with the desipramine concentration changes. Thus, when coadministered with 50 mg/day desipramine, sertraline had significantly less pharmacokinetic interaction than paroxetine with desipramine at the recommended starting dosages of 50 mg/day and 20 mg/day, respectively."	0.05	0.02	17

description:
SUBJECTS: Fifteen healthy men (nine EMs and six PMs) participated in the study. Their mean (+/-SD) age was 27 +/- 4 years and 27 +/- 5 years, and their mean body weight was 71 +/- 8 kg and 84 +/- 11 kg for EMs and PMs, respectively (Table 1). All volunteers were nonsmokers and healthy as determined by routine physical examination, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests.

METHODS: Subjects received oral doses (N = 5) of 18.75 mg venlafaxine hydrochloride (Effexor, Wyeth-Ayerst Canada, Inc., Montreal, Canada) every 12 hours for 48 hours on two occasions: once alone and once during the concomitant administration of 50 mg of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl, Warner Wellcome, Scarborough, Canada) every 12 hours. Diphenhydramine was also administered alone and during concomitant administration of venlafaxine. The three study arms were performed 1 week apart. Venlafaxine tablets were prepared by the Department of Pharmacy, Laval Hospital, by cutting 37.5-mg venlafaxine hydrochloride tablets in half. No other drugs, caffeine-containing foods or beverages, chocolate, or alcohol were allowed 48 hours before and during the study.

RESULTS: When venlafaxine was administered alone, mean
AUC0–12 values for all subjects studied were 3.1 +/- 2.2 umol.hr-1.L-1 in PMs and 0.8 +/- 0.6 umol.hr-1.L-1 in EMs, respectively ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). The right panels of Figure 2 illustrate plasma concentrations of venlafaxine measured after the oral administration of venlafaxine during concomitant administration of diphenhydramine in the same PM and EM. Coadministration of diphenhydramine did not alter the plasma concentrations of venlafaxine in the PM. In contrast, diphenhydramine increased the AUC0–12 of venlafaxine more than 4-fold in the EM, leading to values toward those measured in the PM subject. On average, diphenhydramine increased venlafaxine AUC0–12 by more than 2-fold in EMs ( p &amp;lt; 0.05).

Figure 3 and Table 2 report the pharmacokinetic parameters observed in EMs and PMs on venlafaxine alone and during concomitant administration of diphenhydramine. The mean oral clearance of venlafaxine was more than 4-fold greater in EMs compared with PMs when venlafaxine was administered alone. In EMs, coadministration of diphenhydramine decreased oral clearance of venlafaxine by more than 2-fold ( p &amp;lt; 0.05), leading to values close to those measured in PMs. In contrast, coadministration of diphenhydramine did not affect the oral clearance of venlafaxine in PMs."	0.0375	0.1

description:
SUBJECTS: Only the patients who were first-episode, had not obtained significant therapeutic effects or could not tolerate the side effects using clozapine, risperidone or any other antipsychotic drugs were enrolled in the study. In the study, 21 Chinese in-patients were involved; 2 subjects discontinued the study due to side effects of erythromycin on the digestive tract. Of the subjects who completed the study, 19 (10 females, 9 males; age 18–45 years, weight 41–60 kg) were diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder (criteria of CCMD-III). They refrained from cigarettes and alcohol.

METHODS: During the first period (days 1–8), multiple and rising doses of quetiapine were given to the subjects twice daily (b.i.d). The dosage started at 25 mg b.i.d, reached 200 mg b.i.d by day 4 and remained at 200 mg b.i.d on days 5–7. Only a morning dose of quetiapine (200 mg) was given on days 8. During the second period (days 9–12), fixed doses of quetiapine (200 mg, b.i.d) and erythromycin (500 mg, three times daily) were co-administered to the subjects. A final combination dose of quetiapine (200 mg) and erythromycin (500 mg) was given in the morning of days 12.

RESULTS: For quetiapine, co-administration of quetiapine and erythromycin led to 68, 129 and 92% increases in mean C_max (P=0.001), AUC_0–inf (P=0.000) and t_1/2 (P=0.000), respectively,"	0.4	1.5	19

route of administration: oral

study duration: Fluoxetine was dosed at 40 mg/day for 11 days. On the morning of the 12th day participants received a final dose of antidepressant followed by a 3-mCi dose of radio-labled erythromycin by IV then, 20 minutes later, a 2 mg dose of alprazolam orally. (See NOTE below)

population: 16 healthy males, non-smokers, 

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms? Yes; &quot;subjects were phenotyped with dextromethorphan prior to entering the study to exclude CYP2D6-poor metabolizers&quot;

ages:18 - 25

description:
Compared to baseline, venlafaxine, sertraline, and fluoxetine caused no apparent inhibition or induction of erythromycin metabolism ( P &gt; 0.05). For nefazodone, a statistically significant inhibition was observed ( P &lt; 0.0005). Nefazodone was also the only antidepressant that caused a significant change in ALPZ disposition, decreasing its area under the concentration ï¿½ versus ï¿½ time curve (AUC; P &lt; 0.01), and increasing its elimination half-life (16.4 vs. 12.3 hours; P &lt; 0.05) compared with values at  aseline. No significant differences were found in the pharmacokinetics of ALPZ with any of the other antidepressants tested. 


NOTE: Although erythromycin is known to inhibit CYP3A4 activity, it is the opinion of DIKB reviewer's, the dose of erythromycin given in this study was too low to have any relevant inhibitory effect on CYP3A4"	0.002	0.04	16

Route of administration: oral

study duration: volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of  pravastatin (study II).

population: 10 : 7 male, 3 female

ages:19-29

RESULTS: 
In study II, itraconazole slightly increased the AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of pravastatin, but the changes were statistically nonsignificant (p = 0.052 and 0.172, respectively). The t1/2 was not altered. The AUC(0-infinity) and Cmax of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were increased less than twofold (p &lt; 0.05 and p = 0.063, respectively) by itraconazole.

NOTE: a statistically significant increase in HMG-CoA inhibitors occured  but we cannot distinguish which metabolites of pravastatin were increased from the study"	0.04	0.2	10

description:
SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy volunteers (8 men and 4 women), aged 20 to 40 years, participated after giving written informed consent. All were active ambulatory nonsmoking adults, with no evidence of medical disease and taking no other medications. Female subjects were not taking oral contraceptives and did not have contraceptive implants. One of the subjects did not ingest zolpidem as instructed during treatment; accordingly mean values for itraconazole treatment, n=11.

METHODS: At 8 AM on study day 1, subjects entered the outpatient Clinical Psychopharmacology Research Unit where they received the initial dose of azole (or placebo) and remained under observation for 30 minutes. Subjects took a second dose of azole (or placebo) at home at 4 PM on day 1. On the morning of day 2, after ingesting a standardized light breakfast with no caffeine-containing food or beverages and no grapefruit juice, they returned to the Research Unit at approximately 7:30 AM. They fasted until 12 noon, after which they resumed a normal diet (without grapefruit juice or caffeine-containing food or beverages). The third dose of azole (or placebo) was given at 8 AM, and the single dose of zolpidem or placebo was given at 9 AM. A final azole (or placebo) dose was given at 5 PM.

RESULTS: Coadministration of zolpidem with itraconazole reduced clearance (320 and 338 mL/min), but differences compared to the zolpidem plus placebo treatment did not reach significance.

reaction: R- and S-citalopram --&gt; R- and S- demethylcitalopram

Quote:

Chemical Inhibition of CT and DCT Biotransformation in
Microsomes. At 10micM R- or S-CT, ketoconazole reduced reaction velocity to 55 to 60% of control, quinidine to 80% of control, and omeprazole to 80 to 85% of control (Fig. 6). When the R- and S-CT concentration was increased to 100 M, the degree of inhibition by
ketoconazole increased, while inhibition by quinidine decreased (Fig. 6). These findings are consistent with the data from heterologously expressed CYP isoforms.

polymorphic enzyme: yes

study duration: single 120mg oral dose of diltiazem with 24 hours of plasma level monitoring

population: 15 individuals; 5 for each genetically based phenotype. Study does not state gender of participants

ages: 20-30

description: 
The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its major metabolites in healthy human volunteers representing different CYP2D6 genotypes. METHODS: Norwegians of Caucasian origin were screened for their CYP2D6 genotype on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) by melting-curve analysis of allele-specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes hybridized to polymerase chain reaction-amplified deoxyribonucleic acid. The first 5 individuals identified with genotypes corresponding to a homozygous extensive, heterozygous extensive, or homozygous poor CYP2D6-metabolizing phenotype, respectively, were voluntarily enrolled in the pharmacokinetic study. The participants received diltiazem, 120 mg, as a single oral dose, and plasma samples were collected up to 24 hours after administration. Plasma samples were purified by solid phase extraction. Diltiazem and 7 phase I metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem was not significantly different between the subgroups. However, the systemic exposure of the pharmacologically active metabolites desacetyl diltiazem and N-demethyldesacetyl diltiazem was &gt; or = 5 times higher in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers than in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (P &lt;.01). CONCLUSIONS: CYP2D6 activity does not have a major impact on the disposition of diltiazem. In contrast, desacetyl diltiazem and N-demethyldesacetyl diltiazem are markedly accumulated in individuals expressing a deficient CYP2D6 phenotype. Because these metabolites exhibit pharmacologic properties of possible importance, individual CYP2D6 activity might be an aspect to consider in the clinical use of diltiazem."

description:
Two randomized, double-blind, two-phase crossover studies were performed with use of an identical design, one with simvastatin (study I) and one with pravastatin (study II). In both studies, 10 healthy volunteers received either 200 mg itraconazole or placebo orally once a day for 4 days. On day 4, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of simvastatin (study I) or pravastatin (study II). Serum concentrations of simvastatin, simvastatin acid, pravastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, itraconazole, and hydroxyitraconazole were determined. RESULTS: In study I, itraconazole increased the peak serum concentrations (Cmax) and the areas under the serum concentration-time curve [AUC(0-infinity)] of simvastatin and simvastatin acid at least tenfold (p < 0.001)."

description: 
Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the CYP3A5 genotype on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Nineteen healthy male volunteers were divided into 3 groups on the basis of the genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5. The groups comprised subjects with CYP3A5*1/*1 (n=5), CYP3A5*1/*3 (n=7), or CYP3A5*3/*3 (n=7). After a single oral 1-mg dose of alprazolam, plasma concentrations of alprazolam were measured up to 72 hours, together with assessment of psychomotor function by use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, according to CYP3A5 genotype. RESULTS: The area under the plasma concentration-time curve for alprazolam was significantly greater in subjects with CYP3A5*3/*3 (830.5+/-160.4 ng . h/mL [mean+/-SD]) than in those with CYP3A5*1/*1 (599.9+/-141.0 ng . h/mL) (P=.030). The oral clearance of alprazolam was also significantly different between the CYP3A5*1/*1 group (3.5+/-0.8 L/h) and CYP3A5*3/*3 group (2.5+/-0.5 L/h) (P=.036). Although a trend was noted for the area under the Digit Symbol Substitution Test score change-time curve (area under the effect curve) to be greater in subjects with CYP3A5*3/*3 (177.2+/-84.6) than in those with CYP3A5*1/*1 (107.5+/-44), the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=.148). CONCLUSIONS: The CYP3A5*3 genotype affects the disposition of alprazolam and thus influences the plasma levels of alprazolam."

Metabolism

Following oral administration, eszopiclone is extensively metabolized by oxidation and demethylation. The primary plasma metabolites are (S)-zopiclone-N-oxide and (S)-N-desmethyl zopiclone; the latter compound binds to GABA receptors with substantially lower potency than eszopiclone, and the former compound shows no significant binding to this receptor. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 enzymes are involved in the metabolism of eszopiclone. Eszopiclone did not show any inhibitory potential on CYP450 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 in cryopreserved human hepatocytes."

CYP3A4 is a major metabolic pathway for elimination of eszopiclone. The AUC of eszopiclone was increased 2.2-fold by coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, 400 mg daily for 5 days. Cmax and t1/2 were increased 1.4-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, troleandomycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) would be expected to behave similarly."

&quot;Evaluation of BUP Hydroxylation by Individual cDNA-Expressed Human P450s. Because the biphasic kinetic data observed with low activity HLMs (HLMs 20 and 24) indicated the contribution of more than one enzyme to BUP hydroxylation at higher substrate concentrations, a panel of eight cDNA-expressed enzymes (SUPER- SOMES) was screened for BUP hydroxylase activity at 12 mM to identify enzymes requiring further investigation (Fig. 7). This sub- strate concentration was selected to ensure saturation of any high Km isozyme capable of catalyzing BUP hydroxylation. cDNA-expressed CYP2B6 demonstrated the highest rate of HBUP formation (7.0 pmol/min/pmol of P450). cDNA-expressed CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 catalyzed BUP hydroxylation at the second and third highest rates, although at 3- and 30-fold lower rates than cDNA-expressed CYP2B6 (2.4 and 0.23 pmol/min/pmol of P450, respectively).

Metabolism: Celecoxib metabolism is primarily mediated via CYP2C9. Three metabolites, a primary alcohol, the corresponding carboxylic acid and its glucuronide conjugate, have been identified in human plasma. These metabolites are inactive as COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors.

CYP2C9 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity, such as those homozygous for the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 polymorphisms. Limited data from 4 published reports that included a total of 8 subjects with the homozygous CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype showed celecoxib systemic levels that were 3- to 7-fold higher in these subjects compared to subjects with CYP2C9*1/*1 or *I/*3 genotypes. The pharmacokinetics of celecoxib have not been evaluated in subjects with other CYP2C9 polymorphisms, such as *2, *5, *6, *9 and *11. It is estimated that the frequency of the homozygous *3/*3 genotype is 0.3% to 1.0% in various ethnic groups. "

Metabolism

Pantoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Pantoprazole metabolism is independent of the route of administration (intravenous or oral). The main metabolic pathway is demethylation, by CYP2C19, with subsequent sulfation; other metabolic pathways include oxidation by CYP3A4. There is no evidence that any of the pantoprazole metabolites have significant pharmacologic activity. "

Description:
The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of itraconazole (hereafter referred to as ITZ) co-administration (CYP3A4 inhibition) on the pharmacokinetics of ARIPIPRAZOLE administered to 24 healthy adult male volunteers in a fasting condition. The influence of CYP3A4 inhibition was also examined by CYP2D6 genotype. All subjects were administered a single oral dose of ARIPIPRAZOLE alone in Period I and a single oral dose of ARIPIPRAZOLE following administration of ITZ at 100 mg/day for 7 consecutive days in Period II. The pharmacokinetic parameters of ARIPIPRAZOLE and its main metabolite OPC-14857 were determined. Co-administration of ITZ increased the Cmax, AUC336 hr, and t1/2,z of ARIPIPRAZOLE and OPC-14857 by 19.4%, 48.0%, and 18.6% and by 18.6%, 38.8%, and 53.4%, respectively. By co-administration of ITZ, the CL/F of ARIPIPRAZOLE in extensive metabolizers was decreased by 26.6%, with an even greater decrease (47.3%) in intermediate metabolizers. For the co-administration period, the CL/F of ARIPIPRAZOLE in intermediate metabolizers was about half of that in extensive metabolizers. For Cmax, there was no significant difference between extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers, and the percent change by co-administration of ITZ was less than 20% in both extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers. For OPC-14857, the t(max) in intermediate metabolizers was longer than that in extensive metabolizers, with the difference being amplified by co-administration of ITZ. The AUC336 hr showed similar increases by co-administration of ITZ in all genotypes. The urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol concentration ratio following ITZ administration for 7 consecutive days was about half of that before the start of ITZ administration, indicating that CYP3A4 metabolic activity was inhibited by administration of ITZ. The influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of ARIPIPRAZOLE was not considered to be clinically significant. On the other hand, definite differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between CYP2D6 genotypes. "

METHODS: cDNA-expressed CYP isoforms were used to identify the isoforms that are able to mediate the N-dealkylation of perphenazine, which is considered a major metabolic pathway for the drug. Using human liver microsomal preparations (HLM), inhibition studies were carried out to establish the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved in the N-dealkylation reaction... Ketoconazole inhibition of N-dealkylation mediated by a mixed HLM indicated that CYP3A4 accounted for about 40% of perphenazine N-dealkylation at therapeutically relevant concentrations.The contribution of the CYP isoforms 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 amounted to 20-25% each as measured by the percentage inhibition obtained by addition of furafylline, fluvoxamine or quinidine, respectively.

Metabolism

Pantoprazole is extensively metabolized in the liver through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Pantoprazole metabolism is independent of the route of administration (intravenous or oral). The main metabolic pathway is demethylation, by CYP2C19, with subsequent sulfation; other metabolic pathways include oxidation by CYP3A4. There is no evidence that any of the pantoprazole metabolites have significant pharmacologic activity. "

CYP2D6 Inhibitors: In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that venlafaxine is metabolized to its active metabolite, ODV, by CYP2D6, the isoenzyme that is responsible for the genetic polymorphism seen in the metabolism of many antidepressants. Therefore, the potential exists for a drug interaction between drugs that inhibit CYP2D6-mediated metabolism and venlafaxine. However, although imipramine partially inhibited the CYP2D6-mediated metabolism of venlafaxine, resulting in higher plasma concentrations of venlafaxine and lower plasma concentrations of ODV, the total concentration of active compounds (venlafaxine plus ODV) was not affected. Additionally, in a clinical study involving CYP2D6-poor and -extensive metabolizers, the total concentration of active compounds (venlafaxine plus ODV), was similar in the two metabolizer groups. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is required when venlafaxine is coadministered with a CYP2D6 inhibitor.

Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, carbamazepine) could cause an increase in aripiprazole clearance and lower blood levels. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, quinidine, fluoxetine, or paroxetine) can inhibit aripiprazole elimination and cause increased blood levels.

Ketoconazole and Other CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (itraconazole) would be expected to have similar effects and need similar dose reductions; moderate inhibitors (erythromycin, grapefruit juice) have not been studied. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.

Quinidine and Other CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Coadministration of a 10 mg single dose of aripiprazole with quinidine (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, by 35%. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when quinidine is given concomitantly with aripiprazole. Other significant inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine or paroxetine, would be expected to have similar effects and should lead to similar dose reductions. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased. When adjunctive ABILIFY is administered to patients with Major Depressive Disorder, ABILIFY should be administered without dosage adjustment as specified in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3).

Carbamazepine and Other CYP3A4 Inducers

Coadministration of carbamazepine (200 mg twice daily), a potent CYP3A4 inducer, with aripiprazole (30 mg/day) resulted in an approximate 70% decrease in Cmax and AUC values of both aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole. When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled. Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. When carbamazepine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced."

AUC_i/AUC (336hr): 1075/736 = 1.48

Description:
The objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of itraconazole (hereafter referred to as ITZ) co-administration (CYP3A4 inhibition) on the pharmacokinetics of ARIPIPRAZOLE administered to 24 healthy adult male volunteers in a fasting condition. The influence of CYP3A4 inhibition was also examined by CYP2D6 genotype. All subjects were administered a single oral dose of ARIPIPRAZOLE alone in Period I and a single oral dose of ARIPIPRAZOLE following administration of ITZ at 100 mg/day for 7 consecutive days in Period II. The pharmacokinetic parameters of ARIPIPRAZOLE and its main metabolite OPC-14857 were determined. Co-administration of ITZ increased the Cmax, AUC336 hr, and t1/2,z of ARIPIPRAZOLE and OPC-14857 by 19.4%, 48.0%, and 18.6% and by 18.6%, 38.8%, and 53.4%, respectively. By co-administration of ITZ, the CL/F of ARIPIPRAZOLE in extensive metabolizers was decreased by 26.6%, with an even greater decrease (47.3%) in intermediate metabolizers. For the co-administration period, the CL/F of ARIPIPRAZOLE in intermediate metabolizers was about half of that in extensive metabolizers. For Cmax, there was no significant difference between extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers, and the percent change by co-administration of ITZ was less than 20% in both extensive metabolizers and intermediate metabolizers. For OPC-14857, the t(max) in intermediate metabolizers was longer than that in extensive metabolizers, with the difference being amplified by co-administration of ITZ. The AUC336 hr showed similar increases by co-administration of ITZ in all genotypes. The urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol concentration ratio following ITZ administration for 7 consecutive days was about half of that before the start of ITZ administration, indicating that CYP3A4 metabolic activity was inhibited by administration of ITZ. The influence of CYP3A4 inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of ARIPIPRAZOLE was not considered to be clinically significant. On the other hand, definite differences in pharmacokinetics were observed between CYP2D6 genotypes. "

inhibitor used: ketoconazole

reaction: perphenazine N-dealkylation

Quote: 
To identify the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms mediating the N-dealkylation of the antipsychotic drug perphenazine in vitro and estimate the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved. METHODS: cDNA-expressed CYP isoforms were used to identify the isoforms that are able to mediate the N-dealkylation of perphenazine, which is considered a major metabolic pathway for the drug. Using human liver microsomal preparations (HLM), inhibition studies were carried out to establish the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved in the N-dealkylation reaction... Ketoconazole inhibition of N-dealkylation mediated by a mixed HLM indicated that CYP3A4 accounted for about 40% of perphenazine N-dealkylation at therapeutically relevant concentrations.The contribution of the CYP isoforms 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 amounted to 20-25% each as measured by the percentage inhibition obtained by addition of furafylline, fluvoxamine or quinidine, respectively.

route of administration: oral

study duration: single dose of perphenazine (0.11 mg/kg orally) or placebo following a randomized double-blind design. Perphenazine plasma concentrations and effects were assessed for a period of 8 hours. Subsequently, subjects were treated with a standard therapeutic dose of paroxetine (20 mg/day orally) for 10 days and test sessions with perphenazine and placebo were repeated.

population: 8 adults (5 female, 3 male); all CYP2D6 EMs as determined by the dextromethorphan metabolite ration

ages: 21 - 49

Description: 
Paroxetine treatment resulted in a twofold to 21-fold decrease in CYP2D6 activity (p &lt; 0.001). After pretreatment with paroxetine, perphenazine peak plasma concentrations increased twofold to 13-fold (p &lt; 0.01). This was associated with a significant increase in central nervous system side effects of perphenazine, including oversedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, and impairment of psychomotor performance and memory (p &lt; 0.05).

Tamoxifen is extensively metabolized after oral administration. N-desmethyl tamoxifen is the major metabolite found in patientsâ€™ plasma. The biological activity of N-desmethyl tamoxifen appears to be similar to that of tamoxifen. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen and a side chain primary alcohol derivative of tamoxifen have been identified as minor metabolites in plasma. Tamoxifen is a substrate of cytochrome P-450 3A, 2C9 and 2D6, and an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein."

Route of administration: oral

polymorphic enzyme: yes

study duration: single 120mg oral dose of diltiazem with 24 hours of plasma level monitoring

population: 15 individuals; 5 for each genetically based phenotype. Study does not state gender of participants

ages: 20-30

description:
The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its major metabolites in healthy human volunteers representing different CYP2D6 genotypes. METHODS: Norwegians of Caucasian origin were screened for their CYP2D6 genotype on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) by melting-curve analysis of allele-specific fluorescence resonance energy transfer probes hybridized to polymerase chain reaction-amplified deoxyribonucleic acid. The first 5 individuals identified with genotypes corresponding to a homozygous extensive, heterozygous extensive, or homozygous poor CYP2D6-metabolizing phenotype, respectively, were voluntarily enrolled in the pharmacokinetic study. The participants received diltiazem, 120 mg, as a single oral dose, and plasma samples were collected up to 24 hours after administration. Plasma samples were purified by solid phase extraction. Diltiazem and 7 phase I metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of diltiazem was not significantly different between the subgroups. However, the systemic exposure of the pharmacologically active metabolites desacetyl diltiazem and N-demethyldesacetyl diltiazem was &gt; or = 5 times higher in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers than in extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers (P &lt;.01). CONCLUSIONS: CYP2D6 activity does not have a major impact on the disposition of diltiazem. In contrast, desacetyl diltiazem and N-demethyldesacetyl diltiazem are markedly accumulated in individuals expressing a deficient CYP2D6 phenotype. Because these metabolites exhibit pharmacologic properties of possible importance, individual CYP2D6 activity might be an aspect to consider in the clinical use of diltiazem."

Agents that induce CYP3A4 (eg, carbamazepine) could cause an increase in aripiprazole clearance and lower blood levels. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (eg, quinidine, fluoxetine, or paroxetine) can inhibit aripiprazole elimination and cause increased blood levels.

Ketoconazole and Other CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (itraconazole) would be expected to have similar effects and need similar dose reductions; moderate inhibitors (erythromycin, grapefruit juice) have not been studied. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased.

Quinidine and Other CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Coadministration of a 10 mg single dose of aripiprazole with quinidine (166 mg/day for 13 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, increased the AUC of aripiprazole by 112% but decreased the AUC of its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, by 35%. Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of its normal dose when quinidine is given concomitantly with aripiprazole. Other significant inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine or paroxetine, would be expected to have similar effects and should lead to similar dose reductions. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be increased. When adjunctive ABILIFY is administered to patients with Major Depressive Disorder, ABILIFY should be administered without dosage adjustment as specified in DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3).

Carbamazepine and Other CYP3A4 Inducers

Coadministration of carbamazepine (200 mg twice daily), a potent CYP3A4 inducer, with aripiprazole (30 mg/day) resulted in an approximate 70% decrease in Cmax and AUC values of both aripiprazole and its active metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole. When carbamazepine is added to aripiprazole therapy, aripiprazole dose should be doubled. Additional dose increases should be based on clinical evaluation. When carbamazepine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced."

Metabolism

Zafirlukast is extensively metabolized. The most common metabolic products are hydroxylated metabolites which are excreted in the feces. The metabolites of zafirlukast identified in plasma are at least 90 times less potent as LTD4 receptor antagonists than zafirlukast in a standard in vitro test of activity. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that the hydroxylated metabolites of zafirlukast excreted in the feces are formed through the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) pathway. "

In vitro drug metabolism studies suggest that there is a potential for drug interactions when trazodone is given with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Ritonavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the Cmax, AUC, and elimination half-life, and decreased clearance of trazodone after administration of ritonavir twice daily for 2 days. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were co-administered. It is likely that ketoconazole, indinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or nefazodone may lead to substantial increases in trazodone plasma concentrations, with the potential for adverse effects. If trazodone is used with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.

Metabolism

After oral administration, zaleplon is extensively metabolized, with less than 1% of the dose excreted unchanged in urine. Zaleplon is primarily metabolized by aldehyde oxidase to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. Zaleplon is metabolized to a lesser extent by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 to form desethylzaleplon, which is quickly converted, presumably by aldehyde oxidase, to 5-oxo-desethylzaleplon. These oxidative metabolites are then converted to glucuronides and eliminated in urine. All of zaleplon's metabolites are pharmacologically inactive. "

Quote:
cDNA-expressed CYP isoforms were used to identify the isoforms that are able to mediate the N-dealkylation of perphenazine, which is considered a major metabolic pathway for the drug. Using human liver microsomal preparations (HLM), inhibition studies were carried out to establish the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved in the N-dealkylation reaction. RESULTS: CYP isoforms 1A2, 3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19 and 2D6 were able to mediate the N-dealkylation of perphenazine. Reaction velocities and their relative abundance in HLM suggested that CYP1A2, 3A4, 2C19 and 2D6 were the most important contributors to N-dealkylation. Apparent Km values of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 were in the range 1-2 microM, and Km values of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 were 14 microM and 7.9 microM, respectively."

Consequently, concentrations of Sï¿½norfluoxetine at steady state were lower. The metabolism of Rï¿½fluoxetine in these poor metabolizers appears normal. When compared with normal metabolizers, the total sum at steady state of the plasma concentrations of the 4 active enantiomers was not significantly greater among poor metabolizers. Thus, the net pharmacodynamic activities were essentially the same. Alternative, nonsaturable pathways (nonï¿½2D6) also contribute to the metabolism of fluoxetine. This explains how fluoxetine achieves a steadyï¿½state concentration rather than increasing without limit.

&quot;Drugs That Inhibit Cytochrome P450 2D6

In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher Cmax and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared to rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs that inhibit P450 2D6 or the presence of reduced activity levels of this isozyme will produce elevated plasma levels of thioridazine. Therefore, the co-administration of drugs that inhibit P450 2D6 with thioridazine and the use of thioridazine in patients known to have reduced activity of P450 2D6 are contraindicated.&quot;"

inhibitor used: ketoconazole

reaction: perphenazine N-dealkylation

Quote: 
To identify the human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms mediating the N-dealkylation of the antipsychotic drug perphenazine in vitro and estimate the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved. METHODS: cDNA-expressed CYP isoforms were used to identify the isoforms that are able to mediate the N-dealkylation of perphenazine, which is considered a major metabolic pathway for the drug. Using human liver microsomal preparations (HLM), inhibition studies were carried out to establish the relative contributions of the CYP isoforms involved in the N-dealkylation reaction... Ketoconazole inhibition of N-dealkylation mediated by a mixed HLM indicated that CYP3A4 accounted for about 40% of perphenazine N-dealkylation at therapeutically relevant concentrations.The contribution of the CYP isoforms 1A2, 2C19 and 2D6 amounted to 20-25% each as measured by the percentage inhibition obtained by addition of furafylline, fluvoxamine or quinidine, respectively.

Quote:

The effect of paroxetine or sertraline on steady-state plasma concentrations of clozapine and its major metabolites was studied in 17 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder stabilized on clozapine therapy (200-400 mg/day). In order to treat negative symptomatology or concomitant depression, 9 patients received additional paroxetine (20-40mg/day) and 8 patients sertraline (50-100 mg/day). After 3 weeks of paroxetine administration, mean plasma concentrations of clozapine and norclozapine increased significantly by 31% (p&lt;0.01) and by 20% (p&lt;0.05), respectively, while levels of clozapine N-oxide remained almost unchanged.

Zafirlukast is extensively metabolized. The most common metabolic products are hydroxylated metabolites which are excreted in the feces. The metabolites of zafirlukast identified in plasma are at least 90 times less potent as LTD4 receptor antagonists than zafirlukast in a standard in vitro test of activity. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that the hydroxylated metabolites of zafirlukast excreted in the feces are formed through the cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) pathway.

Quote:
In a randomized, double-blind, 5-trial clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study, 12 volunteers received 0.125 mg triazolam orally, together with placebo, azithromycin, erythromycin, or clarithromycin. In a fifth trial they received placebo plus placebo...Apparent oral clearance was significantly reduced (P < .05) during erythromycin and clarithromycin trials (146 and 95 mL/min).

The effects of triazolam on dynamic measures were nearly identical when triazolam was given with placebo or azithromycin, but benzodiazepine agonist effects were enhanced during erythromycin and clarithromycin trials."

Quote:
&quot;The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between azithromycin (CAS 83905-01-5), an azalide antibiotic, and midazolam (CAS 59467-70-8), a short-acting hypnotic agent, was investigated in an open, three-way cross-over study, including erythromycin (CAS 114-07-8) as a positive control. Twelve healthy male and female subjects had standard doses of azithromycin (500 mg o.d. over 3 days), or erythromycin (500 mg t.i.d. over 5 days), or no pretreatment. On the day of the last dose, they ingested 15 mg midazolam. Blood samples were collected and psychometric tests performed. Erythromycin pretreatment (E) significantly changed the pharmacokinetics of midazolam compared to control (C), whereas azithromycin (A) had no such effect. The parameters are summarized as follows: area under the concentration-time curve, AUC (C) 173.8 h.ng.ml-1 vs. (E) 662.7 h.ng.ml-1*+ and (A) 220.0 h.ng.ml-1; concentration maxima (C) 67.2 ng.ml-1 vs. (E) 182.3 ng.ml-1*+ and (A) 86.7 ng.ml-1; elimination half-life (C) 2.21 h vs. (E) 4.85 h* and (A) 2.41 h (* p &lt; 0.05 vs. (C), +p &lt; 0.05 vs. (A)). Pharmacodynamic tests (digit symbol substitution test; critical flicker fusion test; subjective analog scale for rating of alertness; duration of sleep) consistently showed significant differences after erythromycin pretreatment compared to control, but not after azithromycin. Erythromycin, but not azithromycin, causes clinically significant changes in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of midazolam.&quot;"

study duration: read description below

population: (fluoxetine group) 14 healthy volunteers (7 male and 7 female), all extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan

ages: mean(std dev): 26 (unknown)

Description: 
In an open label, parallel group study of 45 healthy volunteers, the time course of CYP2D6 inhibition of the above SSRIs was evaluated. Subjects were randomized to receive paroxetine at 20 mg/day for 10 days; sertraline at 50 mg/day for 3 days, followed by sertraline at 100 mg/day for 10 days; or fluoxetine at 20 mg/day for 28 days. CYP2D6 activity was assessed using the dextromethorphan metabolic ratio (DMR) on antidepressant days 5 and 10 for sertraline and paroxetine and at weekly intervals for fluoxetine. Following SSRI discontinuation, calculation of a CYP2D6 inhibition half-life (t(1/2)inh) revealed the time course of fluoxetine inhibition (t(1/2)inh = 7.0 +/- 1.5 days) to be significantly longer than either paroxetine (t(1/2)inh = 2.9 +/- 1.9) or sertraline (t(1/2)inh = 3.0 +/- 3.0) (p &lt; 0.01), but the latter were not significantly different from each other (p &gt; 0.05). Time for the extrapolated DMR versus time log-linear plots to return to baseline was significantly different between fluoxetine (63.2 +/- 5.6 days) and both paroxetine (20.3 +/- 6.4 days) and sertraline (25.0 +/- 11.0 days) (p &lt; 0.01), making the rank order (from longest to shortest) of time for CYP2D6 inhibition to dissipate: fluoxetine &gt; sertraline &gt;or= paroxetine. Differences between mean baseline DMR values and measured values obtained after drug discontinuation for each drug group became nonsignificant on discontinuation day 5 for both paroxetine and sertraline and on discontinuation day 42 for fluoxetine.

Coadministration of fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain antidepressants (e.g., TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) should be approached with caution. Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow therapeutic index (see list below) should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks. Thus, his/her dosing requirements resemble those of poor metabolizers. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for decreased dose of the original medication should be considered. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (e.g., flecainide, propafenone, vinblastine, and TCAs). Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS).

Description: 
The urinary concentration ratio of dextromethorphan:dextrorphan (interpreted as an in vivo index of CYP2D6 activity) was determined for each subject before and after the 8 days of receiving SSRIs. Plasma SSRI trough concentrations were measured on days 6-9. The CYP2D6 genotype was determined in a subject with an undetectable paroxetine concentration. Inhibition of CYP2D6 correlated significantly with plasma concentrations of paroxetine and fluoxetine. In contrast, no significant correlations emerged between CYP2D6 inhibition and plasma concentrations of sertraline or fluvoxamine. The subject with an undetectable paroxetine concentration was found to carry at least three functional CYP2D6 genes."

In vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes show that voriconazole inhibits the metabolic activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. In these studies, the inhibition potency of voriconazole for CYP3A4 metabolic activity was significantly less than that of two other azoles, ketoconazole and itraconazole. In vitro studies also show that the major metabolite of voriconazole, voriconazole N-oxide, inhibits the metabolic activity of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to a greater extent than that of CYP2C19.

In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that modafinil reversibly inhibited CYP2C19 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations of modafinil. CYP2C19 is also reversibly inhibited, with similar potency, by a circulating metabolite, modafinil sulfone. Although the maximum plasma concentrations of modafinil sulfone are much lower than those of parent modafinil, the combined effect of both compounds could produce sustained partial inhibition of the enzyme. Drugs that are largely eliminated via CYP2C19 metabolism, such as diazepam, propranolol, phenytoin (also via CYP2C9) or S-mephenytoin may have prolonged elimination upon coadministration with PROVIGIL and may require dosage reduction and monitoring for toxicity."

We investigated the interaction between triazolam and diltiazem in a randomized, three-phase crossover study. Seven healthy male volunteers received orally either a single 0.25 mg dose of triazolam, a 0.25 mg dose of triazolam after a 3-day treatment of diltiazem (180 mg day-1), or a placebo. Plasma samples were collected to determine triazolam concentration over a 24 h period. The pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam were investigated using the peak saccadic velocity of eye movements (PSV), electroencephalogram (EEG), and visual analogue scale (VAS) through 8 h. RESULTS: Diltiazem pretreatment significantly increased the area under the triazolam concentration-time curve (8.0 +/- 2.4 to 18.2 +/- 3.1 ng ml-1 h; P < 0.001; mean +/- s.d.). Peak triazolam concentration was increased (2.1 +/- 0.7 to 3.6 +/- 1.0 ng ml-1, P < 0.05) and the elimination half-life prolonged (4.1 +/- 2.1 to 7.6 +/- 1.9 h; P < 0.01).

study duration: read description below

population: (sertraline group) 12 healthy volunteers (8 male and 4 female), all extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan

ages: mean(std dev): 27 (unknown)

Description: 
In an open label, parallel group study of 45 healthy volunteers, the time course of CYP2D6 inhibition of the above SSRIs was evaluated. Subjects were randomized to receive paroxetine at 20 mg/day for 10 days; sertraline at 50 mg/day for 3 days, followed by sertraline at 100 mg/day for 10 days; or fluoxetine at 20 mg/day for 28 days. CYP2D6 activity was assessed using the dextromethorphan metabolic ratio (DMR) on antidepressant days 5 and 10 for sertraline and paroxetine and at weekly intervals for fluoxetine. Following SSRI discontinuation, calculation of a CYP2D6 inhibition half-life (t(1/2)inh) revealed the time course of fluoxetine inhibition (t(1/2)inh = 7.0 +/- 1.5 days) to be significantly longer than either paroxetine (t(1/2)inh = 2.9 +/- 1.9) or sertraline (t(1/2)inh = 3.0 +/- 3.0) (p &lt; 0.01), but the latter were not significantly different from each other (p &gt; 0.05). Time for the extrapolated DMR versus time log-linear plots to return to baseline was significantly different between fluoxetine (63.2 +/- 5.6 days) and both paroxetine (20.3 +/- 6.4 days) and sertraline (25.0 +/- 11.0 days) (p &lt; 0.01), making the rank order (from longest to shortest) of time for CYP2D6 inhibition to dissipate: fluoxetine &gt; sertraline &gt;or= paroxetine. Differences between mean baseline DMR values and measured values obtained after drug discontinuation for each drug group became nonsignificant on discontinuation day 5 for both paroxetine and sertraline and on discontinuation day 42 for fluoxetine.

Many drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder, e.g., the SSRIs, including sertraline, and most tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder inhibit the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by P450 2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by 2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic index, e.g., the tricyclic antidepressant drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide. The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of P450 2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the coadministered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact sertraline at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even sertraline has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition. Consequently, concomitant use of a drug metabolized by P450 2D6 with sertraline may require lower doses than usually prescribed for the other drug. Furthermore, whenever sertraline is withdrawn from cotherapy, an increased dose of the coadministered drug may be required (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions: Tricyclic Antidepressant Drugs Effective in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder).

In vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes show that voriconazole inhibits the metabolic activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. In these studies, the inhibition potency of voriconazole for CYP3A4 metabolic activity was significantly less than that of two other azoles, ketoconazole and itraconazole. In vitro studies also show that the major metabolite of voriconazole, voriconazole N-oxide, inhibits the metabolic activity of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to a greater extent than that of CYP2C19. Therefore, there is potential for voriconazole and its major metabolite to increase the systemic exposure (plasma concentrations) of other drugs metabolized by these CYP450 enzymes."

Drug Interactions
...
In vitro studies using human liver microsomes showed that modafinil reversibly inhibited CYP2C19 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations of modafinil. CYP2C19 is also reversibly inhibited, with similar potency, by a circulating metabolite, modafinil sulfone. Although the maximum plasma concentrations of modafinil sulfone are much lower than those of parent modafinil, the combined effect of both compounds could produce sustained partial inhibition of the enzyme. Drugs that are largely eliminated via CYP2C19 metabolism, such as diazepam, propranolol, phenytoin (also via CYP2C9) or S-mephenytoin may have prolonged elimination upon coadministration with PROVIGIL and may require dosage reduction and monitoring for toxicity."

...
Amiodarone is also known to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, amiodarone has the potential for interactions with drugs or substances that may be substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4. While only a limited number of in vivo drug-drug interactions with amiodarone have been reported, the potential for other interactions should be anticipated. This is especially important for drugs associated with serious toxicity, such as other antiarrhythmics. If such drugs are needed, their dose should be reassessed and, where appropriate, plasma concentration measured. In view of the long and variable half-life of amiodarone, potential for drug interactions exists, not only with concomitant medication, but also with drugs administered after discontinuation of amiodarone."

Route of administration: oral

polymorphic enzyme: NO

study duration: 5 day petreatment with clarithromycin 

population: 4 male, 8 female

ages:24-53

In an open randomized crossover study of 3 phases 12 healthy volunteers received either clarithromycin (250 mg twice a day for 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg once a day for 3 days) or no pretreatment. On the last day of antibiotic treatment they ingested 15 mg midazolam. Plasma samples were collected for midazolam analysis up to 24 h and pharmacodynamic performance measured by a series of tests up to 12 h. Pretreatment with clarithromycin caused large and statistically significant changes in both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of midazolam compared to control. For example, the AUC was increased from 248.84-888.75 hng/ml (factor of 3.57, p < 0.0001) and the mean duration of sleep increased from 135.4 min to 281.3 min (p < 0.05)."

study duration: &quot;Study 1 was conducted in 2 distinct periods separated by a 7-day washout. In period 1, a single 50-mg dose of desipramine was administered, and blood samples were obtained for the measurement of desipramine plasma concentrations immediately before the dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hours after dosing. In period 2, duloxetine was administered at an initial dose of 40 mg twice daily. Subjects who did not tolerate this dose were allowed to have the dose lowered to 20 mg twice daily for up to 5 doses, after which dosing at 40 mg twice daily was resumed. On the seventh day of duloxetine dosing (day 14 of the overall protocol), the dose was increased to 60 mg twice daily and was continued at that level for an additional 14 days. On day 21 of the overall protocol (day 8 of duloxetine 60 mg twice daily dosing), a 50-mg dose of desipramine was administered. Blood samples were drawn to determine desipramine plasma concentrations as described for period 1, with additional samples at 168 and 192 hours after the desipramine dose. On the day before and the day of the period 2 desipramine dose (protocol days 20 and 21), blood samples for the measurement of duloxetine plasma concentrations were drawn immediately before duloxetine administration and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours after administration.&quot;

population: 14 healthy, non-smoking, adults; 7 male, 7 female; nearly all were of apparent European decent (&quot;white&quot;)

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms? yes but exact genotype not mentioned only that all were genotypically CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.

ages: 21 - 63

description:
&quot;Duloxetine increased the maximum plasma concentration of desipramine 1.7-fold and the area under the concentration-time curve 2.9-fold.&quot;

In vitro studies did not reveal an inhibitory effect of escitalopram on CYP2D6. In addition, steady state levels of racemic citalopram were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of citalopram, suggesting that coadministration, with escitalopram, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on escitalopram metabolism. However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of escitalopram (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of escitalopram and drugs metabolized by CYP2D6."

Although bupropion is not metabolized by this isoenzyme, bupropion and hydroxybupropion are inhibitors of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme in vitro. In a study of 15 male subjects (ages 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme, daily doses of bupropion given as 150mg twice daily followed by a single dose of 50mg desipramine increased the Cmax, AUC, and t1/2 of desipramine by an average of approximately 2-, 5- and 2-fold, respectively. The effect was present for at least 7 days after the last dose of bupropion. Concomitant use of bupropion with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 has not been formally studied.

route of administration: oral

study duration: &quot;dextromethorphan (30-mg oral dose) was administered to smokers at baseline and after 17 days of treatment with either bupropion sustained-release (150 mg twice daily) or matching placebo. Subjects quit smoking 3 days before the second dextromethorphan administration.&quot;

population: 21 smoking, 9 female, 11 male

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms? yes ... all participants were considered CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers according to dextromethorphan:dextrorphan metabolite ratio

ages: 21 - 40

NOTE: &quot;24-hour period preceding each laboratory visit. Two subjects reported taking medications that could potentially affect CYP2D6 metabolism and therefore alter bupropion concentrations (one reported use of hormone replacement therapy and another oral contraceptives).&quot;

description:
&quot;Among those taking bupropion, DM/DX ratio in-
creased significantly at the second assessment relative to the first (0.012 ï¿½ 0.012 vs. 0.418 ï¿½ 0.302; P &lt; 0.0004) (Fig. 1). No such change was observed in those randomized to placebo (0.009 ï¿½ 0.010 vs. 0.017 ï¿½ 0.015; P = NS). Of those receiving bupropion, 46% (6/13) were phenotypically poor metabolizers after treatment.&quot;

In vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes show that voriconazole inhibits the metabolic activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. In these studies, the inhibition potency of voriconazole for CYP3A4 metabolic activity was significantly less than that of two other azoles, ketoconazole and itraconazole. In vitro studies also show that the major metabolite of voriconazole, voriconazole N-oxide, inhibits the metabolic activity of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to a greater extent than that of CYP2C19. Therefore, there is potential for voriconazole and its major metabolite to increase the systemic exposure (plasma concentrations) of other drugs metabolized by these CYP450 enzymes."

description:
Relative to when desipramine was administered alone, a
3.6-fold increase in AUC(0-inf) and 1.8-fold increase in Cmax of desipramine was observed when cinacalcet was
administered for 5 days before and 2 days after dosing
with desipramine (Table 1, Fig. 1). Administration with
cinacalcet resulted in an increase in the AUC(0-inf) and Cmax of desipramine for all subjects (Fig. 2). Coadministration of desipramine and cinacalcet also resulted in a notable reduction in desipramine oral clearance. The terminal half-life of desipramine was also increased by approximately twofold when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet. The median tmax was 6 h following administration of desipramine alone and following administration
with cinacalcet.

In vitro studies with human hepatic microsomes show that voriconazole inhibits the metabolic activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. In these studies, the inhibition potency of voriconazole for CYP3A4 metabolic activity was significantly less than that of two other azoles, ketoconazole and itraconazole. In vitro studies also show that the major metabolite of voriconazole, voriconazole N-oxide, inhibits the metabolic activity of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 to a greater extent than that of CYP2C19. Therefore, there is potential for voriconazole and its major metabolite to increase the systemic exposure (plasma concentrations) of other drugs metabolized by these CYP450 enzymes."

In vivo studies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of LAMISILï¿½ should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in Cmax and a 5-fold increase in AUC. In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of LAMISILï¿½. "

study duration: read description below

population: (paroxetine group) 13 healthy volunteers (8 male and 5 female), all extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan

ages: mean(std dev): 28 (unknown)

Description: 
In an open label, parallel group study of 45 healthy volunteers, the time course of CYP2D6 inhibition of the above SSRIs was evaluated. Subjects were randomized to receive paroxetine at 20 mg/day for 10 days; sertraline at 50 mg/day for 3 days, followed by sertraline at 100 mg/day for 10 days; or fluoxetine at 20 mg/day for 28 days. CYP2D6 activity was assessed using the dextromethorphan metabolic ratio (DMR) on antidepressant days 5 and 10 for sertraline and paroxetine and at weekly intervals for fluoxetine. Following SSRI discontinuation, calculation of a CYP2D6 inhibition half-life (t(1/2)inh) revealed the time course of fluoxetine inhibition (t(1/2)inh = 7.0 +/- 1.5 days) to be significantly longer than either paroxetine (t(1/2)inh = 2.9 +/- 1.9) or sertraline (t(1/2)inh = 3.0 +/- 3.0) (p &lt; 0.01), but the latter were not significantly different from each other (p &gt; 0.05). Time for the extrapolated DMR versus time log-linear plots to return to baseline was significantly different between fluoxetine (63.2 +/- 5.6 days) and both paroxetine (20.3 +/- 6.4 days) and sertraline (25.0 +/- 11.0 days) (p &lt; 0.01), making the rank order (from longest to shortest) of time for CYP2D6 inhibition to dissipate: fluoxetine &gt; sertraline &gt;or= paroxetine. Differences between mean baseline DMR values and measured values obtained after drug discontinuation for each drug group became nonsignificant on discontinuation day 5 for both paroxetine and sertraline and on discontinuation day 42 for fluoxetine.

population: 32 healthy adults, all extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers based on DM:DX

ages: unmentioned

Description: 
The urinary concentration ratio of dextromethorphan:dextrorphan (interpreted as an in vivo index of CYP2D6 activity) was determined for each subject before and after the 8 days of receiving SSRIs. Plasma SSRI trough concentrations were measured on days 6-9. The CYP2D6 genotype was determined in a subject with an undetectable paroxetine concentration. Inhibition of CYP2D6 correlated significantly with plasma concentrations of paroxetine and fluoxetine. In contrast, no significant correlations emerged between CYP2D6 inhibition and plasma concentrations of sertraline or fluvoxamine. The subject with an undetectable paroxetine concentration was found to carry at least three functional CYP2D6 genes."

Quote:
To determine whether preincubation affects the inhibition of human liver microsomal dextromethorphan demethylation activity by paroxetine, we used a two-step incubation scheme in which all of the enzyme assay components, minus substrate, are preincubated with paroxetine...Time-dependent inhibition was demonstrated with an apparent K(I) of 4.85 microM and an apparent k(INACT) value of 0.17 min(-1). Spectral scanning of CYP2D6 with paroxetine yielded an increase in absorbance at 456 nm suggesting paroxetine inactivation of CYP2D6 via the formation of a metabolite intermediate complex.
...In contrast, quinidine and fluoxetine, both of which are inhibitors of CYP2D6 activity, did not exhibit a preincubation-dependent increase in inhibitory potency. These data are consistent with mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 by paroxetine but not by quinidine or fluoxetine."

Description: 
During paroxetine, the median clearances were 22 l.h-1 and 18 l.h-1 in EMs and PMs respectively. The 5-fold decrease in clearance in EMs when desipramine was co-administered with paroxetine confirms that paroxetine is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6. The lack of effect on clearance in PMs shows that paroxetine is a selective inhibitor of CYP2D6, which is absent from the livers of PMs. Before paroxetine, the median of desipramine clearance via 2-hydroxylation was 40-times higher in EMs than in PMs (56 and 1.4 l.h-1 respectively), but during paroxetine, it was only 2-times higher (6 and 2.9 l.h-1 respectively)."

study duration: a single 25 mg dose of racemic warfarin either alone or on Day 15 of a 21-day oral dosing regimen of 40 mg citalopram daily. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were obtained over a 168 h period after warfarin dosing.

population: 12 healthy males 

tested for known CYP450 polymorphisms? no

ages: 21 - 32

description:
Citalopram produced no change in the pharmacokinetics of (R)- and (S)-warfarin, indicating that citalopram does not alter the metabolism of warfarin mediated via CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9.

description:
Potential for inhibition of CYP3A activity by simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects who received placebo or 80 mg of simvastatin, the maximal recommended dose, once daily for 7 consecutive days. On day 7, an intravenous injection of 3 microCi [14C N-methyl]erythromycin for the erythromycin breath test (EBT) was coadministered with a 2 mg oral solution of midazolam. The values for percent 14C exhaled during the first hour (for EBT) and the pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam (AUC, Cmax, t1/2) were not affected following multiple once-daily oral doses of simvastatin 80 mg. The 95% confidence interval was 0.97 to 1.18 for EBT and 0.99 to 1.23 for midazolam AUC. In addition, the total urinary recoveries of midazolam and its 1'-hydroxy metabolites (free plus conjugate) obtained from both treatments were not statistically different (p &gt; 0.200). These data demonstrate that multiple dosing of simvastatin, at the highest recommended clinical dose, does not significantly alter the in vivo hepatic or intestinal CYP3A4/5 activity as measured by the commonly used EBT and oral midazolam probes."

probe reaction: phenacetin O-deethylation

Quote: 

In all systems the positive control inhibitors produced the expected degree of inhibition of their respective index reactions (Table 1). CYP1A2. R- and S-CT and metabolites all were negligible inhibitors
of phenacetin O-deethylation, the index reaction for CYP1A2. None of these compounds produced 50% inhibition. The mean IC50 for alpha-naphthoflavone was 0.2micM, and the mean IC50 for fluvoxamine was 0.3micM.

In vitro studies did not reveal an inhibitory effect of escitalopram on CYP2D6. In addition, steady state levels of racemic citalopram were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers after multiple-dose administration of citalopram, suggesting that coadministration, with escitalopram, of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6, is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on escitalopram metabolism. However, there are limited in vivo data suggesting a modest CYP2D6 inhibitory effect for escitalopram, i.e., coadministration of escitalopram (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in Cmax and a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine. The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of escitalopram and drugs metabolized by CYP2D6."

CYP2D6. Only R-DCT had potentially important inhibiting potency versus CYP2D6, represented by dextromethorphan O-demethylation. The mean IC50 was 25.5 (+/-2.1)micM. This is very close to the inhibitory potency of sertraline and is consistent with clinical data suggesting that racemic citalopram and sertraline have comparably weak CYP2D6 inhibitory potency. The SSRI paroxetine was at least an order of magnitude more potent (IC50 2.6micM) than R-DCT as a CYP2D6 inhibitor (see Table 2). Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine (mean IC50 = 2.0 and 2.7micM, respectively) also were strong CYP2D6 inhibitors.

However, indinavir may be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6.

Route of administration: oral

polymorphic enzyme: NO

study duration: 7 days

population: 12 male

ages:21-41

description:
Potential for inhibition of CYP3A activity by simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects who received placebo or 80 mg of simvastatin, the maximal recommended dose, once daily for 7 consecutive days. On day 7, an intravenous injection of 3 microCi [14C N-methyl]erythromycin for the erythromycin breath test (EBT) was coadministered with a 2 mg oral solution of midazolam. The values for percent 14C exhaled during the first hour (for EBT) and the pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam (AUC, Cmax, t1/2) were not affected following multiple once-daily oral doses of simvastatin 80 mg. The 95% confidence interval was 0.97 to 1.18 for EBT and 0.99 to 1.23 for midazolam AUC. In addition, the total urinary recoveries of midazolam and its 1'-hydroxy metabolites (free plus conjugate) obtained from both treatments were not statistically different (p &gt; 0.200). These data demonstrate that multiple dosing of simvastatin, at the highest recommended clinical dose, does not significantly alter the in vivo hepatic or intestinal CYP3A4/5 activity as measured by the commonly used EBT and oral midazolam probes."
