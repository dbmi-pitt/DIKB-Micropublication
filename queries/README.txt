These queries were written for use with the MP/OA/NP model prototype.

All of the queries in this folder have been completed and work as of 7/10/2015 and commit f752b11591. The queries that are in this folder have been marked off as **done** in the "use-cases.txt" file, also located in this folder. This file also contains a key that explains the naming system used for all of the SPARQL queries, and it gives an overview of what the queries are intended to accomplish.

Many of the queries have variables, such as drug or assertion names, that can be switched out to yield different results. I chose values that I believed would yield significant results for the test queries.

All of the queries only query into the MP model, as the more complicated queries that require the use of NP have not yet been written. Those queries would include any queries that require the subject, predicate, and object of the NP:Assertions to be returned while maintaining their order and roles. This is something that cannot be accomplished by using solely the MP/OA model.
