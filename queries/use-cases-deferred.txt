==Deferred==
1. Which claims have evidence from source X? (extend product labeling query to iterate over source types)
2. Which evidence items are related to evidence item X, using PubMed "related to"?
3. Show the distribution of the levels of evidence for various claim types
(e.g., pharmacokinetic claims) **NOT DOING YET**
4. Are the evidence use assumptions for evidence item X concordant?
5. Are the evidence use assumptions for evidence item X unique? 
6. Are the evidence use assumptions for evidence item X non-ambiguous?
7. How many pharmacokinetic studies in the DIKB used for evidence items
for claim X are based on data from the product label? **talking to rich, skip for now**
8. What is the result of applying some statistical operation to the values for pharmacokinetic parameter X across all relevant studies used for evidence items? (averaging is PK2)
9. For the product labeling used for evidence item X: Original
manufacturer or repackager? 
10. For the product labeling used for evidence item X: Most current label or outdated? 
11. For the product labeling used for evidence item X: Is the drug on market in country X or not?

==Deferred: Support updates to evidence and claims==
===Change status of redundant and rejected evidence===
1. Remove a older version of a redundant evidence item **NOT DOING YET**
2. Change the modality of a supporting evidence item to be a refuting evidence item **NOT DOING YET**
==Update when key sources change==
1. Get all claims that are supported by evidence items identified from
an FDA guidance or other source document just released as an updated
version. **done in a way, specialized version of 4.1.1.c**
