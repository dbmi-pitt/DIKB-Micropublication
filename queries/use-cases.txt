==Find assertion==
# List all assertions that are not supported by evidence  **done**
# Which assertions are supportedBy just one type of evidence?
# Which assertions are challengedBy just one type of evidence?
# Which assertions have evidence from source X (e.g., product labeling)  **done**
# Which assertions have both evidence for and evidence against from a single source X?

==Find evidence==
# List all evidence for or against assertion X (by evidence type, drug, drug
pair, transporter, metabolic enzyme, etc.)     **to check**
# What is the in vitro evidence for assertion X? the in vivo evidence?
# List all evidence that has been tagged as rejected from entry into the
the knowledge base
# Which single evidence items act as support or rebuttal for multiple assertions of type X (e.g., substrate of assertions)?    **to check**

==Assess evidence==
# What data, methods, materials, are reported in evidence item X?
# Which evidence items are related to and follow-up on evidence item X?
# Which research group conducted the study used for evidence item X?
# Are the evidence use assumptions for evidence item X concordant? unique?
non-ambiguous?

===Verify plausibility of an evidence item===
# Has evidence item X been rejected for assertion Y? If so, why and by
whom?
# Which other assertions are being supported/challenged by this evidence
item?
# What are the assumptions required for use of this evidence item to sup-
port/challenge assertion X?

===Checking assertions about pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., area
under the concentration time curve (AUC))===
# How many pharmacokinetic studies used for evidence items in the DIKB
could be used to support or challenge an assertion about pharmacokinetic
parameter X (e.g., `X increases AUC')? **done** (note, mostly encompassed in 4.1.1c)
# How many pharmacokinetic studies in the DIKB used for evidence items
for assertion X are based on data from the product label? **talking to rich, skip for now**
# What is the result of averaging (or applying some other statistical oper-
ation) to the values for pharmacokinetic parameter X across all relevant
studies used for evidence items?

===Check for differences in the product labeling===
# Are there differences in the evidence items that were identified across
different versions of product labeling for the same drug?
# What version of product labeling was used for evidence item X? Original
manufacturer or repackager? Most current label or outdated? Is the drug
on market in country X or not? American or country X?


==Summarize statistical information about the evidence base==
# Number of assertions in the system **done**
# Number of evidence items for and against each assertion type
# Show the distribution of the evidence types for the various assertion types


==Deferred queries==

==Summarize evidence base==
# Show the distribution of the levels of evidence for various assertion types
(e.g., pharmacokinetic assertions) **NOT DOING YET**

==Support updates to evidence and assertions==
===Change status of redundant and rejected evidence===
# Remove a older version of a redundant evidence item **NOT DOING YET**
# Change the modality of a supporting evidence item to be a refuting
evidence item **NOT DOING YET**
==Update when key sources change==
# Get all assertions that are supported by evidence items identified from
an FDA guidance or other source document just released as an updated
version. **done in a way, specialized version of 4.1.1.c**
