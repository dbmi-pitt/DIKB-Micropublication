==FA: Find assertions==
1. List all assertions that are not supported by evidence  **done**
2. Which assertions are supportedBy just one evidence item?
3. Which assertions are challengedBy just one evidence item?
4. Which assertions are supportedBy just one type of evidence?
5. Which assertions are challengedBy just one type of evidence?
6. Which assertions have evidence from product labeling? **done**
7. Which assertions have both evidence for and evidence against from a single source X?

==FE: Find evidence==
1. List all evidence for or against assertion X by evidence type  **to check**
2. List all evidence for or against assertion X by drug **to check**
3. List all evidence for or against assertion X by drug pair **to check**
4. List all evidence for or against assertion X by transporter **to check**
5. List all evidence for or against assertion X by metabolic enzyme **to check**
6. What is the in vitro evidence for assertion X? 
7. What is the in vivo evidence for assertion X?
8. List all evidence that has been tagged as rejected from entry into the
the knowledge base
9. Which single evidence items act as support or rebuttal for multiple assertions of type "substrate of"?    **to check**
10. Which single evidence items act as support or rebuttal for multiple assertions of type "inhibits"?
11. Which single evidence items act as support or rebuttal for multiple assertions of type "increases AUC"?

==AE: Assess evidence==
1. What data, methods, materials, are reported in evidence item X?
2. Which evidence items cite an existing evidence item (or something from the evidence item)?
3. Which evidence items update a regulatory item (e.g. FDA guidance document, change to product label, etc...)?
4. Which research group conducted the study used for evidence item X?
6. Are the evidence use assumptions for evidence item X concordant? unique?
non-ambiguous?

===VPE: Verify plausibility of an evidence item===
1. Has evidence item X been rejected for assertion Y? If so, why and by
whom?
2. Which other assertions are being supported/challenged by this evidence
item?
3. What are the assumptions required for use of this evidence item to sup-
port/challenge assertion X?

===PK: Checking assertions about pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., area
under the concentration time curve (AUC))===
1. How many pharmacokinetic studies used for evidence items in the DIKB
could be used to support or challenge an assertion about pharmacokinetic
parameter X (e.g., `X increases AUC')? **done** (note, mostly encompassed in 4.1.1c)
2. How many pharmacokinetic studies in the DIKB used for evidence items
for assertion X are based on data from the product label? **talking to rich, skip for now**
3. What is the result of averaging (or applying some other statistical oper-
ation) to the values for pharmacokinetic parameter X across all relevant
studies used for evidence items?

===PROD: Check for differences in product labeling===
1. Are there differences in the evidence items that were identified across
different versions of product labeling for the same drug?
2. What version of product labeling was used for evidence item X? Original
manufacturer or repackager? Most current label or outdated? Is the drug
on market in country X or not? American or country X?


==STAT: Summarize statistical information about the evidence base==
1. Number of assertions in the system **done**
2. Number of evidence items for and against each assertion type
3. Show the distribution of the evidence types for the various assertion types
