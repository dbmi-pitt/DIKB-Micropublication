===PK: Check assertions about pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., area under the concentration time curve (AUC))===
1. How many pharmacokinetic studies used for evidence items in the DIKB
could be used to support or challenge an assertion about pharmacokinetic
parameter X (e.g., `X increases AUC')? **done** (note, mostly encompassed in 4.1.1c)

studies used for evidence items?
