==AE: Assess evidence==
1. What data, methods, materials, are reported in evidence item X?

3. Which evidence items update a regulatory item (e.g. FDA guidance document, change to product label, etc...)?
4. Which research group conducted the study used for evidence item X?


===VPE: Verify plausibility of an evidence item===

===PK: Check assertions about pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., area under the concentration time curve (AUC))===
1. How many pharmacokinetic studies used for evidence items in the DIKB
could be used to support or challenge an assertion about pharmacokinetic
parameter X (e.g., `X increases AUC')? **done** (note, mostly encompassed in 4.1.1c)
2. What is the result of averaging the values for pharmacokinetic parameter X across all relevant
studies used for evidence items?

1. Are there differences in the evidence items that were identified across
different versions of product labeling for the same drug?
2. What version of product labeling was used for evidence item X?


==STAT: Summarize statistical information about the evidence base==
1. Number of assertions in the system **done**
2. Number of evidence items for each assertion type
3. Number of evidence items against each assertion type
4. Show the distribution of the evidence types for the various assertion types
